I don't get any calls to NativeJavaPackage.getPkgProperty for variables that are defined at the top level. \n\nIn your example code, I was assuming that \"application\" and \"Calendar\" were defined by your application. Are you using shared scopes or any other configuration that might come into play here?\n\nAnd as far as intent, I was not trying to detect dynamically loaded classes by repeatedly attempting to load them. I'm fine with Rhino only attempting to load a class once and upon failure thereafter assuming it doesn't exist.",

            "body": "Created attachment 312652\nProposed patch\n\nThanks--that test case illustrated what was going on. \n\nWhen a script is first started, Rhino must look up variables defined in the script and merge them with previous definitions. To perform this merge it has to look them up in the scope, and with importerTopLevel having package imports it causes a call to getPkgProperty for each variable. The first call to runTestScript didn't trigger this behavior because the importPackage calls had not yet been made. \n\nI think the best option here is, as you suggest, to maintain a cache of misses so we don't retry the class lookup. I've attached a proposed patch. Can you let me know if this change addresses the performance issue?\n\nThanks for your help.",

Once you replace importPackage() with importClass(), there is no performance issue.\n\nExpected Results:  \nThe performance is the same or better with newer release (1.6x)\n\nAfter investigation it turned out the problem is either in caching inside the\nNativeJavaPackage.getPkgProperty(String name, Scriptable start, boolean createPkg), or in the general approach in the TopLevelScope. It looks like EVERY variable goes through the package evaluation process whenever importPackage has been used. The getPkgProperty() takes care of the previously FOUND classes but does not cache the information about classes that HAVE NOT BEEN FOUND, thus searching over and over for the classes that does not exist and failed previously.\n\nAs a workaround I used my own class loaded that caches the information about not found classes and fails fast. However, either the clarification on the actual intent (read - 'yes, we want to dynamically check for new classes') or the fix is needed here.",
