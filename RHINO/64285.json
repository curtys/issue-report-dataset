A separate\nJDK 1.3 directory was created under C:\\Program Files\\JavaSoft\\JRE\\.\n\n\nFurthermore, my PATH variable has not changed: \n                          etc. \n                          etc.\nC:/jdk1.2.2/bin: C:/Program Files/JavaSoft/JRE/1.2/bin:\n                          etc. \n                          etc.\n\n\nI have not been successful at using the \"-j\" option of the test driver\nto force it to use JDK 1.2.2. Also, I haven't been able to do it directly\nat the command line. I tried this (for readablity I've added CR's):\n\n\"/Program Files/JavaSoft/JRE/1.2/bin/java\" \n    org.mozilla.javascript.tools.shell.Main \n       -f /d/JS_TRUNK/mozilla/js/tests/ecma_3/shell.js \n          -f /d/JS_TRUNK/mozilla/js/tests/ecma_3/RegExp/regress-57572.js\n\n\n\nBut I got these errors:\n\njs: Couldn't open file \"/d/JS_TRUNK/mozilla/js/tests/ecma_3/shell.js\".\njs: Couldn't open file \n\"/d/JS_TRUNK/mozilla/js/tests/ecma_3/RegExp/regress-57572.js\".\n\n\n\nThese are correct filepaths, however. For example: \n\n[/d/JS_TRUNK/mozilla/js/tests] ls /d/JS_TRUNK/mozilla/js/tests/ecma_3/shell.js\n/d/JS_TRUNK/mozilla/js/tests/ecma_3/shell.js\n\n\nAny ideas on what I'm doing wrong? \n\n\nAnd WHY is my system going for JDK 1.3, when JDK 1.2.2 still exists,\nand is the only JDK listed in my PATH variable ???",
