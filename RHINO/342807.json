Since the objects resulting from the ECMA-defined \"new Error(msg)\" would now have additional non-ECMA properties, to enable the behaviour I defined a new feature,\n\nContext.FEATURE_LOCATION_INFORMATION_IN_ERROR\n\nYou need to have a Context that returns true for hasFeature(Context.FEATURE_LOCATION_INFORMATION_IN_ERROR) in order for this behaviour.",
