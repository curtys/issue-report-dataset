If this happens, then when a property slot is created after this, it will be assigned to lastAdded.orderedNext inside accessSlot(), resulting in it not being reached when traversing the list starting from firstAdded the next time the properties are enumerated.\n\nThe patch updates getIds(boolean) to ensure lastAdded remains pointing to the last slot in the list.",

The situation the bug occurs in is just:\n\n  * Start with an object that has at least one property and which hasn't had\n    its most recently added property (or properties) deleted\n  * Create a property p1\n  * Delete property p1\n  * Enumerate the object's properties\n  * Create property p2 (where p2 ! p1)\n\nThen p2 won't be enumerated.",

Specifically this happens when:\n\n  * A property p1 with slot index X is created\n  * A property p2 with slot index Y (where X != Y) is created\n  * Property p2 is deleted\n  * The object's properties are enumerated\n  * A property p3 with slot index Y is created\n\nAfter this, p3 is on the object, but won't be enumerated.\n\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nEvaluate the following script:\n\no = { }\no.PageLeft = 1\no.Rect2 = 6\ndelete o.Rect2\nfor (var p in o);\no.Rect3 = 7\nfound = false\nfor (var p in o) if (p == 'Rect3') found = true\njava.lang.System.out.println(\"found = \" + found)\n\nActual Results:  \nPrints out \"found = false\".\n\n\nExpected Results:  \nPrint out \"found = true\".",
