As a side effect it seems to me that the execution time is significantly reduced as well.",

The consequence is that a large number of test failures have been ignored and tests marked as successful whereas they failed :-(\nWith this patch *all* exceptions and errors occurring in the test thread are captured and reported. The consequence is that instead of 150 failed tests with CVS head, I have now 815 failed tests!",
