            "body": "Created attachment 130725\nFix: propagate line number to moved condition  in IRFcatory.createLoop\n\nThe reason for the bug is that the parser did not propagate proper line number\nfor loop condition when it converts internally the while loop to do-while with\nan initial jump to the loop end. As a result JVM byte code for the condition\nwould inherit its line number from the last loop statement. \n\nThe bug does not affect the pure interpreter since the interpreter uses dynamic\ninformation from the last line number mark and there the condition would get\nproper number from the loop as additional goto to the loop end would not affect\nthe last line number mark.\n\nTo address this the patch adds a line mark to the parse tree before the\ncondition.",
