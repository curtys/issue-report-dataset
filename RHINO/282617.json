The relevant part of the\ninterface is trivial and looks like:\n\n  public interface RemoteScriptingHost extends Remote {\n    public Object eval(String expr) throws RemoteException;\n  }\n\nMy problem is when RMI unmarshals the return value and it's undefined, I get an\nexception like:\n\njava.rmi.UnmarshalException: error unmarshalling return; nested exception is: \n\tjava.io.InvalidClassException: org.mozilla.javascript.Undefined; local class\nincompatible: stream classdesc serialVersionUID = 9195680630202616767, local\nclass serialVersionUID = 940272108611353017\n\nBoth applications are launched from the same code base, so I know the versions\nof Undefined match exactly.  Maybe the class needs an explicit serialVersionUID?\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:",
