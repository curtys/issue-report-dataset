The body of the method\norg.mozilla.javascript.tools.debugger.FileHeader::mouseClicked() should be \nempty.\n\nThe mouseReleased() method of the FileTextArea can remain unchanged.  The \nsuggested change does trigger a repaint, but it needs to be processed on \nmouseRelease in the FileHeader class, and this makes the change to the \nFileTextArea unnecessary (the two lines of changes to \nFileTextArea::mouseReleased() here:\n     +        requestFocus();\n     +        getCaret().setVisible(true);\n)\n\nThe changes to removeBreakpoint are needed:\n-            wasBreakpoint = (breakpoints[line] != BREAK_FLAG);\n+            wasBreakpoint = (breakpoints[line] == BREAK_FLAG);\n             \nand I suggest making the FileHeader class look like this (only up to the \nconstructor).

    "description": "User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows NT 4.0)\nBuild Identifier: Rhino 1.5R4\n\nIn the Rhino debugger, clearing a breakpoint does not get properly repainted.\n\nIn the following method (org/mozilla/javascript/tools/debugger/Main.java, \nSourceInfo class):\n\n    synchronized boolean removeBreakpoint(int line) {\n        boolean wasBreakpoint = false;\n        if (breakpoints != null && line < breakpoints.length) {\n            wasBreakpoint = (breakpoints[line] == BREAK_FLAG);\n            breakpoints[line] = 0;\n        }\n        return wasBreakpoint;\n    }\n\nThe line:\n            wasBreakpoint = (breakpoints[line] == BREAK_FLAG);\n\nwas incorrectly coded like this:\n\n            wasBreakpoint = (breakpoints[line] != BREAK_FLAG);\n\nChanging the \"!=\" to \"==\" fixes the bug.\n\nAlso, as a tip to make toggling breakpoints easier, move the body of the \nFileHeader.mouseClicked to FileHeader.mouseReleased. The Java mouseClicked \nevent is too limiting - it is only posted if you press & release the mouse \nbutton on the exact same pixel. It's difficult for many users to be so precise, \nand it winds up looking like the feature doesn't work.\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Set a breakpoint in the Rhino debugger by clicking on the left margin.\n2. Try to remove the breakpoint created in step (1) by clicking on it.\n3. It will NOT disappear.  Move the window off screen and back on screen and it \nwill repaint correctly.\n\nActual Results:  \nIt did not repaint as described above.  See details for a solution to this bug.",
