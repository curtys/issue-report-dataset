Do you want to mark this bug as Fixed, then?\n\nI have modified both tests above now that Rhino and SpiderMonkey\nare in synch on this issue.\n\n    mozilla/js/tests/ecma_3/Statements/regress-121744.js\n    mozilla/js/tests/ecma_3/Statements/regress-131348.js\n\nThe two tests expect contrary things. I've put an early return on the\nformer test, so that it no longer runs in either SpiderMonkey or Rhino.\nI decided to retain it as a record of the issue, rather than CVS-deleting it. \n\nMeanwhile, I have removed the early Rhino return on the latter test, \nso that it tests both SpiderMonkey and Rhino on this issue now.\nIt now passes in both the interpreted and compiled Rhino shells -",

Since ECMA-262 Edition 3 requires ECMAScript to error on them,\nbug 121744 was filed and SpiderMonkey corrected its behavior to match the \nstandard.\n\nBut many complaints ensued because we had changed the behavior of JS,\nand were no longer in agreement with the behavior of NN4.7 and IE6.\nSo bug 131348 was filed, and it was decided to undo the 121744 fix.\n\nIn addition, Waldemar reports in bug 131348 that the ECMA committee is\nleaning toward treating this as a bug in the standard, and changing it\nin Edition 4. So: how does Rhino want to behave on these statements? \n\nWe currently have two testcases, for the two SpiderMonkey bugs:\n\n        mozilla/js/tests/ecma_3/Statements/regress-121744.js\n        mozilla/js/tests/ecma_3/Statements/regress-131348.js\n\nThe two tests expect contrary things. I retain both of them because\nat present, SpiderMonkey and Rhino do contrary things on these statements.\nOnce this bug is resolved, I will adjust the testcases accordingly.",
