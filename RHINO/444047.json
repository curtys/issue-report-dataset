I think \"yield\" and \"let\" take the name of the previous named token.\n\nSo in a pre-JS1.7 shell, \"(x=3)+yield+let\" will evaluate to 9, whether or not yield and let have every been assigned to anything.\n\nI don't know the code well enough to submit a patch, but I think the problem is in TokenStream, near where it says \"// LET and YIELD are tokens only in 1.7 and later\".\n\nThanks.",

For example, given the definition \"var yield = 123\", the statement \"print(yield)\" behaves like \"print(print)\", and \"print(yield = 456)\" behaves like \"print = 456\"!\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Launch the rhino shell with a pre-1.7 language, e.g. \"rhino -version 160\"\n2. Type \"var yield = 123\".\n3. Type \"print(yield)\".\nActual Results:  \nfunction print() {\n\t[native code, arity=1]\n}\n\nExpected Results:  \n123\n\nThe same thing happens with \"let\" instead of \"yield\".  I noticed that the TokenStream class handles these two tokens specially when the language version is less than 1.7; perhaps that code is at fault?",
