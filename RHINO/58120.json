Let t be the result of LocalTime(this time value); but if this time value is      \n   NaN, let t be +0.\n2. Call ToNumber(year).\n3. If Result(2) is NaN, set the [[Value]] property of the this value to NaN \n   and return NaN.\n4. If Result(2) is not NaN and 0 \u00a3 ToInteger(Result(2)) \u00a3 99 then Result(4) is  \n   ToInteger(Result(2)) + 1900. Otherwise, Result(4) is Result(2).\n5. Compute MakeDay(Result(4), MonthFromTime(t), DateFromTime(t)).\n6. Compute UTC(MakeDate(Result(5), TimeWithinDay(t))).\n7. Set the [[Value]] property of the this value to TimeClip(Result(6)).\n8. Return the value of the [[Value]] property of the this value.\n",
