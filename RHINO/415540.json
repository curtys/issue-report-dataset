Here is the testcase:\n\njs> var Constr = function() {};\njs> Constr.prototype = [];\njs> c = new Constr();\njs> c.push(1);\n1\njs> c.push(2);\n2\njs> Array.push(c,3);\n4\njs> c\n1,2\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to file a Bugzilla issue. With a few\npointers I don't mind looking into it but it's probably going to be\nquicker for you to fix it anyway :)\n\nThanks,\nMatthieu",
