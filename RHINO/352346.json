The requirement is in section 10.2.1.1 EscapeElementValue.\n\nThe Rhino E4X implementors of toXMLString however have choosen not do do any escaping on text nodes as\n<http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/js/rhino/xmlimplsrc/org/mozilla/javascript/xmlimpl/XML.java#2897>\nsimply checks\n\nif (curs.isText())\n{\n  result = curs.getChars();\n}\n\nand that getChars method of the XmlCursor in XML beans does not seem to be intended to give you XML markup with proper escaping but rather plain text:\n<http://xmlbeans.apache.org/docs/1.0.4/reference/org/apache/xmlbeans/XmlCursor.html#getChars()>\n\nSo this bug is not specific to text nodes in XMLList objects but simply happens when toXMLString is directly called on an XML object of node kind 'text'.",

E4X wants toXMLString called on an attribute to apply escaping too so that would need to be fixed too.\n\n> Does XmlBeans or Rhino already have code for XML escaping somewhere?\n\nRhino has\n<http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/js/rhino/xmlimplsrc/org/mozilla/javascript/xmlimpl/XML.java#508>\ndumpNode which then makes uses of cursor.xmlText in some cases. Using that it might be possible to at least get well-formed stuff from toXMLString(). It does not look as if XML beans escpapes '>', XML does not require that, but the E4X specification spells out that '>' should be escaped as '&gt;'.\n\nAnd I am more guessing what might help than really understanding the XML beans API.\n\nAre those guys that implemented E4X for Rhino no longer interested in maintaining/fixing it?
