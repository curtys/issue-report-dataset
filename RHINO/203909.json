Then\nIdFunction.createObject simply throws TypeError if the function is not\nexplicitly marked as constructor.\n\nThe current behavior of SM can be obtained if instead of throwing error,\nIdFunction.createObject can call super.createObject.\n\nThe patch should cover all the standard library functions since all of them are\nimplemented in terms of IdFunction and they marked as constructors only when\nthe standard required it.",
