It is broken in 1.7R1 and all 1.6Rx from 1.6R6 on.\n\nI assume that is because of some specific extensions for Java var-args: It works now, if I do not pass \"new Array(...)\" but just put the arguments directly into the method call. However all our old scripts use the old syntax and therefore cannot be executed by the new version.\n\nIt should work with both - an explicit \"new Array(...)\" and with directly putting all arguments as method arguments.\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nSee this little test case for reproducing: http://www.nightlabs.de/~marco/rhino/2009-01-29.00/RhinoTest.tar.gz\nActual Results:  \norg.mozilla.javascript.EvaluatorException being thrown\n\nExpected Results:  \nCorrect method being executed - no exception.",
