This is currently not possible because the Context created by a custom ContextFactory will still refer the global ContextFactory in its \"factory\" field.\nThe consequence is for instance that hasFeature will delegate to the global factory rather than to the custom one.\n\n// ----------- currently -----------\n    public Context()\n    {\n        this(ContextFactory.getGlobal());\n    }\n    \n    Context(ContextFactory factory)\n    {\n        assert factory != null;\n        this.factory = factory;\n        ...\n    }\n// ----------------------\n\n\n\n// ----------- possible solution -----------\n    public Context()\n    {\n        this(ContextFactory.getGlobal());\n    }\n    \n    protected Context(ContextFactory factory)\n    {\n        assert factory != null;\n        this.factory = factory;\n        ...\n    }\n// ----------------------\n\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.\n2.\n3.",
