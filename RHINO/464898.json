            "body": "Looking at the remaining failing bugs, it seems like the two biggest groups are failing due to the missing global options() function in Rhino, and because trying to call js1_8 tests and calling version(180). \n\noption() seems to be used to enable/disable the jit compiler - option() without arguments returns a string with current options status, and it looks like option('jit') should toggle the jit. I couldn't reproduce this in spidermonkey shell - options() always returns an empty string. Maybe spidermonkey always runs with jit and options() is left in for backwards compatibility?\n\nThe js 1.8 issue is strange, because the js1_8 directory is in the skip list. I guess something there's a problem with processing the skip lists here. \n\nBTW, in my local copy with the js 1.8 patches we have already applied, 29 of the js1_8 test cases pass already, which is nice :-)",

JSDriver currently uses a String array and loops over it using startsWith() while StandardTests only checks on a directory/file level. Thus a skip list entry of \"js1_8\" covers directory \"js1_8_1\" in JSDriver, but does not in StandardTests. \n\nAny opinions on which behaviour is more desirable/compatible/whatever?",

Running tests as explained at https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Running_the_Rhino_tests doesn't report any failure (at least for interpreted mode).\nThis shows that there is a big problem at least in one of the two methods.\n\nThe first failing test reported when running the tests as junit tests is lc3/ArrayMethods/object-001.js. Which is not reported as failing by JsDriver.\n\nIf I add following as first statement of JsDriver.excluded:\n            if (!path.contains(\"lc3/ArrayMethods/object-001.js\"))\n            \treturn true;\nand run JsDriver tests again, then only this single test is run... and if fails exactly like when running it as unit test.\n\nFor me this shows a really big problem in the tests. Particularly this seems to mean that we can't trust the results of JsDriver and that the unit test result are (more?) correct. In which case, a lot of tests fail currently!\n\nAdditionally, do we really need JsDriver? It is important to be able to build and run the tests in automatic build process and have usable results that we can trust. JUnit seems better suited for this purpose.\n\nI set the severity of this issue as critical because I think that we can't have any reliable information on Rhino's quality as long as it is not fixed.\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.\n2.\n3.",
