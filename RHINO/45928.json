Note that there is no reason to call the version \nthat even can access the private constructors, since it's a public constructor \nit's looking for. I believe that this affects both Netscape and IE.\n\nuse getConstructor() instead of getDeclaredConstructor(). This is because\nreflective access to the native data formatter is restricted in the browser.",
