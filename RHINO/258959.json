Removal of assumption that Context.getCurrentContext() is not null. In\nprinciple if an application do not wrap serialization code into\nContext.(enter|exit) pair, then it can be considered buggy, but I would not be\nsurprised if ScriptableInputStream is constructed before calling\nContext.enter() somewhere.\n\n2. 3-arg form of Class.forName() is JDK 1.2 feature and to remain compatible\nwith the most widely deployed JVM (JDK 1.1.4-compatible JVM from Microsoft) I\nchanged that to use ClassLoader.loadClass method.",
