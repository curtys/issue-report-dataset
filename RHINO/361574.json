Unzip source\n2. find -type f | xargs grep mag\n3. find -type f | xargs grep msg\n\nActual Results:  \nStep 2 returns only one hit that isn't a comment, step 3 returns ~300 hits.\n\nExpected Results:  \nIf \"mag.too.deep.parser.recursion\" were correct, I'd expect to find \"mag\" elsewhere in the source but I don't.  I assume it's a typo since \"msg\" makes sense, and the a and s keys are near each other.",
