In order to do this, I had to add two new protected methods to the SwingGui class.\n\nshowFileWindow(String, int) is used to display a script resource and move it to the front, optionally selecting a line. This is called both when the debugger moves to a new stop line, and a file is opened via window menu or function list.\n\nupdateFileWindow(Dim.SourceInfo) is called when the code of a source file has been updated. \n\nMaybe to really add extensibility it would be necessary to turn FileWindow (and possibly a few other classes) into public static inner classes, but for the time being, I chose to go with the minimal set of changes that was necessary.\n\nReproducible: Always",
