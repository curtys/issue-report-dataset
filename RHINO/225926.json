If not used as part\n124  * of a quantifer, Perl treats braces literally.\n125  *\n126  * We decided to follow Perl on this for backward compatibility.\n127  * See http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=190685.\n128  *\n129  * Therefore NONE of the following ECMA violations should generate\n130  * a SyntaxError. Note we use checkThis() instead of testThis().\n131  */\n\n\nCurrently Rhino is correctly throwing an error according to ECMA.\nBut do we want to stay in synch with SpiderMonkey on this?",
