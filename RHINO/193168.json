I made a small test file as follows:\n\nvar x;\nx = 1;\nx = 2;\nx = 3;\n//x = 4;\n//x = 5; \nprint(x);\n\nBefore I downloaded the patch for this bug, I ran this file in\nthe Rhino debugger and entered |x| into the Watch pane. I saw\nthe value of x correctly increment from 1 to 3.\n\nI went to the source and removed the comment signs. Back in the\ndebugger, I ran the file again. In the Watch pane, I could see\n|x| increment from 1 to 5 this time, but the source pane still\nshowed these lines as commented out!\n\nAfter downloading the fix for this bug, I repeated the same steps.\nThis time, the source pane updated correctly to the new source,\nas the variable |x| incremented from 1 to 5:\n\nvar x;\nx = 1;\nx = 2;\nx = 3;\nx = 4;\nx = 5; \nprint(x);",
