But I think it should be done differently since org.mozilla.javascript.Kit.newInstanceOrNull does not handle NoSuchMethodException. I am actually not sure anymore why it works, I guess a SecurityException is thrown, which newInstanceOrNull handles.\nSo here a new version that throws exceptions handled by newInstanceOrNull and also uses the strategy proposed by Attila.",

    "description": "Created attachment 275764\nProposed patch\n\nfrom newsgroup:\n\nI run into this problem today when runing Rhino on JDK 1.4 on Mac:\n\njava.lang.NoSuchMethodError: java.lang.reflect.Method.isVarArgs()Z\nat org.mozilla.javascript.jdk15.VMBridge_jdk15.isVarArgs\n(VMBridge_jdk15.java:48)\n\nIt seems that VMBridge_jdk15 is used although I am on 1.4.\n\nLooking at VMBridge's code for deciding which one to use, I saw that  \nit loops through these and tries to instantiate them:\n\norg.mozilla.javascript.VMBridge_custom\norg.mozilla.javascript.jdk15.VMBridge_jdk15\norg.mozilla.javascript.jdk13.VMBridge_jdk13\norg.mozilla.javascript.jdk11.VMBridge_jdk11\n\nAnd for some reason it seems to be able to instantiate VMBridge_jdk15  \non 1.4 and is happy.\n\nI then looked at VMBridge_jdk15 and did not see any condition that  \nshould prevent it from being able to do so. Or should the missing  \nisVarArgs() be enough a reason for it to not load?\n\nIs it just me, or is this currently broken for 1.4?\n\nJ\u00fcrg \n\nAttaching proposed fix from J\u00fcrg from later in the same thread.",
