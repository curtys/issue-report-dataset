Since you are working on tests which are identifiable with definite sections in the spec, I think they should be named accordingly... e4x/XML/13.4.4.32-01.js. I prefer using 01,02, etc just for sorting sake in case we ever have more than 9 subtests.\n\nDavid, again, if the changes to the license block, etc. are ok with you, I'll go ahead and check in the modified version. Thanks for taking the time to do this. I _really_ do appreciate it.",
