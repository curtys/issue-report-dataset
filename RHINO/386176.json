I have made the org.mozilla.javascript.Token class instantiable for this purpose. This doesn't affect the normal compilation/evaluation functionality in any way.",

Just recently I had to do some editing on the AST produced by Rhino (and then regenerate source code from it after editing), and it appears to me that it's easier to work with a tree structure.",
