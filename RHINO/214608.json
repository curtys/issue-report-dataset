But this is wrong since even with\nSecirutyManager installed JVM allows to call Class.getMethos()( and returns\nlist of all public methods in the class and its super classes.\n\nThe patch removes the restrictions while making JavaMembers.lookupClass much\nsimpler.",

    "description": "A work related to bug 201893 made the following regression as reported by Hannes\nWallnoefer in the comments at bug 201893#c6 :\n\n\nI think there are some problems with the patch you committed. I'm no longer able\nto invoke public methods on non-public classes. The error message I get is:\n\nTypeError: undefined is not a function.\n\nWhich may serve as clue, because it's not that we get a security exception when\ninvoking the method, the method is simply not there.\n\nAlso, when trying to invoke a public static method on a non-public class, I get\nthe following message:\n\norg.mozilla.javascript.EvaluatorException: Java class \"java.lang.Object\" has no\npublic instance field or method named \"foo\".",
