    "description": "GCJ 3.3.* which shipped with resent Linux distributions can not compile Rhino as\nis since it crashes while compiling switch statements in ClasFileWriter. The\nreason for this is that the switch statements use byte constants and that is\nknown problem with GCJ which I believe was addressed only recently in GCJ CVS.\n\nTo simplify life for folks who would like to use Rhino with GCJ I suggest to\nimplement a workaround for this and change ByteCode.<constants> to have int\ntype. It would also require changing few prototype signatures in ClassFileWriter\nto accept int constants.",
