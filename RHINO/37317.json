    "description": "In JS, we implement a Java interface and in Java we call methods of this \ninterface from a seperate thread and a \"No context associated with current \nthread\" exception is thrown. Note, this only happens when the method has at \nleast one parameter. If the method has no parameter, it worked fine. I enclosed \nseveral files to illustrate this problem.\n\nHello.java is the interface declaration file.\nSayHello.java is the class that use this interface. \nthread.js is the JS file that implements Hello interface and passes the \ninterface to SayHello class.\nawt.js is a similar JS file which implements actionListener interface and \npasses the interface to Button class. This JS file worked fine. \n\nTo repeat this problem, compile both java files and put the classes in the same \ndirectory as that contains js.jar and jstools.jar, run the following command \nfrom the DOS command:\n\njava -classpath .;js.jar;jstools.jar org.mozilla.javascript.tools.shell.Main\n\nAt JS prompt, type \"load thread.js\", you will get the following exception:\njs> load(\"thread.js\");\ncurrent Thread is Thread[main,5,main]\njs> current Thread is Thread[Thread-0,5,main]\nException caught No Context associated with current Thread\njava.lang.RuntimeException: No Context associated with current Thread\n        at org.mozilla.javascript.Context.getContext()\n        at org.mozilla.javascript.ScriptRuntime.toObject()\n        at org.mozilla.javascript.Context.toObject()\n        at adapter0.print()\n        at SayHello$HelloThread.run()\n\nNotes:\n1) if the print method in the Hello interface doesn't take any parameters, it \nworked fine;\n2) awt.js runs fine, even though the actionPerformed method is called on a \nseperate thread too. I don't know why. \n3) a side problem. importClass can't be used more than once. If I try to \nrun \"load thread.js\" again on the same JS session, I got an exception \nsaying \"property already defined\". I think it should just return quietly \ninstead of throwing an exception, just like importPackage does.\n4) This problem happened in both JDK1.2 and JDK1.1.8.\n\nHoward",
