Also treat \"export\" and \"import\" as ordinary reserved words instead of actual keywords. They are listed as such in the ECMAScript spec, only spidermonkey uses them as actual keywords, but Rhino doesn't implement that feature.",

It seems all browser JS engines including spidermonkey allow these words to be used. Rhino has a FEATURE_RESERVED_KEYWORD_AS_IDENTIFIER which is false by default, and prints a warning message when this feature is set to true and a future reserved word is encountered.\n\nI propose to set the default value for FEATURE_RESERVED_KEYWORD_AS_IDENTIFIER to true and remove the warning.\n\nReproducible: Always",
