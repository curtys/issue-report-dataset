In think it also makes sence to update the get method to\ncache last accessed slot even it has getter/setter, but that is something to\nconsider later.\n\nI can commit the patch later next week as I will be away for few days, but if\nNorris would like to freeze for 1.5R4 sooner, then it is a good idea to include\nthe patch before that.",

As the test is very\nimplementation-specific I doubt it would have any sence to add it to the test suite.",
