Regardless, until those other bugs are \nfixed, the current patch would still improve the existing situation, wouldn't \nit? So the question is, do you see sense in committing this patch until the \nother bugs are tackled? (Your observation would suggest your opinion is that it \ndoes not, but you weren't explicit about it :-) )",
