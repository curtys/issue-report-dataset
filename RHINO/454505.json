Also adds a JS 1.8 language version constant to Context.java. \n\nThe reason I'm using an instance field for inDestructuringAssignment to avoid shorhand notation to pass through in ordinary object literals is for nested assignments like \"var [a, {b}] = ...\". The call stack is really deep here (all the *Expr() methods) so passing this through as argument would add major overhead. Another approach would be to set a property on shorthanded name nodes and check for it later on in the interpreter/compiler like I think spidermonkey does.\n\nThe decompiler still renders the long form, i.e. {f} -> {f:f}. To fix that we'd also have to set a property on the shorthanded name node.",
