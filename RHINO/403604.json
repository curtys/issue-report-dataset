It looks like the problem was caused by introduction of LazilyLoadedCtor.buildValue() in its 1.23 revision. I'm not 100% sure I understand the code, but it does seem to me that it was wrong the way it was, and my change indeed fixed the issue. ",

There were two major commits by Norris Boyd on that day, I think it's the first one which is to blame.\n\nI'll attach a little continuation test script shortly.",

This patch undos that change made in revision 1.281 of ScriptRuntime.java from 2007/11/02 and continuations are working again.\n\nI'm not sure whether the change Attila committed to LazilyLoadedCtor.java is still needed. I've left it in for now, as it don't seem to be any problems with it, but maybe somebody with more grasp should look again.",
