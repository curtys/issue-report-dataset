    "description": "Created attachment 263102\nFix bug in handling day-of-month value in Date constructor, UTC function\n\nThere's a small bug in NativeData.java in how the Date constructor and the UTC function handle the value for the day-of-month component. Currently both map anything less than 1 to 1. According to ECMA-262 (3rd), section 15.9.1.12 step 8, the value should simply be added as-is.\n\nSee also bug 9523 and change 3.19 to jsdate.c\n\nNote that bug 9523 didn't update the date_UTC(...) function, I'll file a bug on that shortly.\n\nThe Date constructor bug was found and fixed by Ilya Frank <ifrank@danger.com>, a colleague of mine at Danger Inc. Based on that I discovered and fixed the UTC function version of the bug.",
