This is apparently due to code added for version 1.7 that checks for duplicate method names.\n\nIMHO defining a static and non-static method should be possible, as the former is placed in the prototype objects, the later in the constructor object.\n\n\n\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Define host class with both jsFunction_ and jsStaticFunction_ using the same name.\n2. Call ScriptableObject.defineClass for the host object\nActual Results:  \nException \"duplicate.defineClass.name\" is thrown\n\nExpected Results:  \nCode accepts both function declarations and creates static function in constructor object and non-static function in prototype object\n\nThis worked in releases prior to 1.7R1",
