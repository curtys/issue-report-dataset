Start JS debugger (org.mozilla.javascript.debugger.Main) \n2. Open several files. Note the list of files in \"Window\" menu. \n3. Close all windows with files. \n \nActual Results:  \nIn \"Window\" menu all windows are still listed. \n\nExpected Results:  \nThere must be empty list. \n\nThe cleanup code exists, but doesn't get called, as it is accidentally \nremoved.",
