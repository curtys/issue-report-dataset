Tracing succeeds, but the user needs\nto manually go through the 'window' menu item to make the active internal frame\nvisible.\n\nAfter speaking with Christopher Oliver, it seems this problem is only apparent\nwith JDK 1.4.1\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. debug application that uses multiple source files\n2. trace through function that invokes a method in another source file\nActual Results:  \nObserved that the trace succeeds but the internal frame window isn't modified.\n\nExpected Results:  \nThe source file windows should be automatically focused when tracing between them.\n\nChristopher Oliver sent me a fix which I tested, I'll attach a patch after\nsubmitting this form.",
