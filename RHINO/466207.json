            "body": "Turns out we can't make NativeArray implement java.util.List or even java.util.Collection since we made ScriptableObject implement java.util.Map with the patch for bug 448816, and Map has a remove(Object) method that is incompatible with that in List/Collection.\n\nI think what we should do is move the Map implementation from ScriptableObject to NativeObject. Making JS-Object -> java.util.Map conversion work for native JS Objects should cover most use cases, and it's not obvious a Function or Date object should auto-convert to a Map. Not sure about custom Host objects, but these can always implement Map or subclass NativeObject.\n\nI'm working on a patch, will post it shortly.",
