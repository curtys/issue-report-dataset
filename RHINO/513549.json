As far as I can tell, whitespace at the beginning and end should be ignored.

Open up the javascript shell\n2. Type in `JSON.parse(\"{} \");\n3. Type in `JSON.parse(\"{}\\n\");\nActual Results:  \nRhino throws a \"SyntaxError: Expected end of stream at char 2\" indicating JSON.parse considers the whitespace after the last } to be invalid JSON.\n\nExpected Results:  \nBoth JSON.parse calls should return a new empty object.\n\nSpiderMonkey's JSON.parse handles trailing whitespace fine. Also I don't believe trailing whitespace is supposed to be considered illegal. After all whitespace doesn't break things anywhere else in a JSON string, why should trailing whitespace be any different?\n\nThis causes issues when reading JSON from files. On POSIX systems files normally end in a newline and most reading methods end up reading in a string with a trailing newline, thus if you try to read a file then JSON.parse it using Rhino's new JSON system you'll get an unexpected (and hard to understand) error.",
