It makes some cleanup in NativeString removing (nearly) all ConstructorId_XXX. This code is the source of the error and it seems to useless (at least no new test fails with these changes). The patch doesn't try to make additional cleanup to stay as simple as possible.",

            "body": "Created attachment 376712\nrevised patch for string generics that uses this-object if called without args\n\nYour patch breaks the basic functionality of the generic String functions: \n\njs> String.toLowerCase(\"FOO\")\nfunction string() { [native code for string.string, arity=1] }\n\nNote that the \"correct\" use of String.toLowerCase.apply would be (where the first argument could really be anything): \n\njs> String.toLowerCase.apply(String, [\"SOME STRING\"]);\n\nBut it looks like spidermonkey checks the arguments and uses the this-object if a string generic funciton is called without arguments. I'll try to implement the same behaviour in Rhino. Anyway we need better argument checking here.\n\nI'm uploading a patch that seems to reproduce spidermonkey behaviour and avoids the ArrayOutOfBound exception. We should probable do the same for the generic Array methods.",
