It takes two things already present in Rhino (JavaAdapters and not wrapping instances of Scriptable) and what comes out is simple and powerful metaprogramming. As we found out on IRC there's a problem with your patch, so I'm uploading a revised patch and a test script.",

This new patch only unwraps the object returned from the JavaAdapter constructor if it is an instance of Scriptable, but leaves the \"self\" field wrapped so we can call the super methods in the parent java class.\n\nThe code is a bit awkward with two instanceof's within close range, but I think this is the only way to implement this without major code restructuring.",

Right now it always wraps it in a NativeJavaObject. But by adding an additional instanceof check and avoiding wrapping of instances of classes that already inherit from Scriptable, we could allow JavaScript to define new Scriptable objects directly from JavaScript, and therefore offer more flexible ways of wrapping Java and JavaScript objects.\n\nReproducible: Always",
