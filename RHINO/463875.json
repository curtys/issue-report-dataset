    "description": "Created attachment 347125\nScriptableObject seal documentation\n\nIn the documentation for ScriptableObject's seal method, there is mention that properties of a sealed object cannot be added or removed. I think it is beneficial to mention that properties can still be changed so someone does not think their object is frozen. I'll attach a patch that mentions this but it may need to be expanded to state that an accessor property cannot be changed to a data property and vice versa per the ES3.1 spec if that is the behavior of Rhino.",
