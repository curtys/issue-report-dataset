The real solution is to implement equals() and hashCode() on the NativeJavaPackage so that it compares both the name and the class loader, see attached patch -- comments welcome.",

This fixes an error that\nshows up if a call to importPackage is encountered twice\nbefore classes from the package actually get referenced.\n\nI encountered this error while working with a flowscript\n(Cocoon's name for javascript+continuations) for a set of\nCocoon forms.  Quickly starting more than one instance of\na form triggers this bug.\n\nThe patch replaces a comparison using '=' between two\nNativeJavaPackage's with a comparison using string equality.\nThis effectively compares the package names instead of\nchecking for object identity.\n\nThe other thing which we might need to check is that the\ntwo NativeJavaPackage's both use the same classloader.\nI would appreciate it if somebody more knowledgeable of\nRhino internals could sanity check this patch. \n\n\nReproducible: Couldn't Reproduce",
