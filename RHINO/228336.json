    "description": "This is the Rhino version of bug 228087 against SpiderMonkey.\nThe following regexp patterns are causing SyntaxErrors:\n\njs> re = /{1.*}/g;\njs: uncaught JavaScript exception: SyntaxError: Invalid quantifier {\n\njs> re = /{1[.!}]*}/g;\njs: uncaught JavaScript exception: SyntaxError: Invalid quantifier {\n\n\nThis is correct per ECMA-262 Ed. 3, which prohibits the use of unescaped\nbraces in regexp patterns unless they form part of a quantifier.\n\nHowever, as part of the SpiderMonkey RegExp rewrite (bug 85721), it was\ndecided to follow Perl and IE, and allow unescaped braces even if they\nare not part of a quantifier.\n\nSee bug 188206 comment 12; also bug 223273 comment 29 and following.\n\nIt looks like the RegExp parser is mistakenly identifying the above\nuse of braces as quantifiers (hence the SyntaxErrors), instead of\nthe non-quantifier, literal use of unescaped braces that we permit.\n\nThe testcase for this bug is \n\n      mozilla/js/tests/ecma_3/RegExp/regress-228087.js\n\nIt is currently failing in both the SpiderMonkey and Rhino shells -",
