Here is a mail from Eric Vasilik\nthat I got when investigating the issue (Rhino uses http://xmlbeans.apache.org/\nto implement E4X and directly call xmlText method there): \n\n\n\n-------- Original Message --------\nSubject: RE: No escape for '>' ?\nDate: Fri, 15 Oct 2004 11:31:46 -0700\nFrom: Eric Vasilik\nReply-To: user@xmlbeans.apache.org\nTo: <user@xmlbeans.apache.org>\n\nI do not believe that \"<a>&lt;>&amp;</a>\" is invalid.  The '>' character\ndoes not need to be escaped.  Here is the BNF for char data from the XML\nspec.\n\n[14]    CharData    ::=    [^<&]* - ([^<&]* ']]>' [^<&]*) \n\nIt requires that there are no un-escaped '&' or '<' characters, as well\nas the CDATA terminating character sequence.\n\n- Eric\n\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: Igor Bukanov [mailto:igor@fastmail.fm]\n> Sent: Friday, October 15, 2004 6:10 AM\n> To: user@xmlbeans.apache.org\n> Subject: No escape for '>' ?\n> \n> Hi!\n> \n> It seems that xmlText() does not escape '>'.
