    "description": "(reported to the list by michael singer)\n\nI wrote a simple program which uses the nt-ns-util contribution to\nregister custom node types written in CND language.\n\nI defined the following (very simple) custom node types:\n\n<test = 'http://foo.bar/test'>\n[test:firstnodetype]\n+ test:secondnodetype mandatory\n\n<test = 'http://foo.bar/test'>\n[test:secondnodetype] > test:firstnodetype\n+ test:thirdnodetype\n\n<test = 'http://foo.bar/test'>\n[test:thirdnodetype] > test:secondnodetype\n- test:catalog (string)  < 'URI', 'URN', 'DOI', 'ISBN', 'ISSN'\n- test:entry (string) m\n\n\nIn the resulting custom_nodetypes.xml each of the custom nodes has a\nsupertype of \"nt:base\" but I didn't explicitely define a supertype of\n\"nt:base\" for [test:secondnodetype] and [test:thirdnodetype].\n\nI think this behavior is wrong since the method getDeclaredSupertypes()\nof class NodeType always returns \"nt:base\" plus the explicitely declared\nSupertype (which it e.g. does not for \"nt:folder\").\n",
