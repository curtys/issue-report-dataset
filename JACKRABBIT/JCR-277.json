The current structure needs a lot of work.\n\nThere is no need to wait for consensus on documentation -- just go ahead and commit what\nyou think is right and everyone else can add to it, or revert what they don't like.\n\nThat layout looks good, but I would remove the HOWTOs, since they are under Documentation.\nI think the first page should be \"Download and Install\", before \"First Steps\".\nAlso, I suggest using a meaningful name instead of numbering the models.\nBut go ahead and do whatever you like first -- it is far easier for me to move stuff\naround after you have written it. ;-)\n",
