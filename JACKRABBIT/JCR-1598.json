    "description": "In this project, the cause of the exception is often ignored, and only the message of the cause is used, as in:\n\n} catch (Exception e) {\n    log.error(\"Error in configuration: {}\", e.toString());\n    throw new ServletException(\"Error in configuration: \" + e.toString());\n}\n\nAn additional problem is that when using ServletException(String message, Throwable rootCause), the rootCause is not used in printStackTrace(), that means the cause is not logged. See also: http://closingbraces.net/2007/11/27/servletexceptionrootcause/\n\nIt is therefore better to convert \n  throw new ServletException(\"Unable to create RMI repository. jcr-rmi.jar might be missing.\", e);\nto\n  ServletException s = new ServletException(\"Unable to create RMI repository. jcr-rmi.jar might be missing.\");\n  s.initCause(e);\n  throw s;\n\n\n\n\n",
