If I share a nt:folder and apply permissions to it to make it read-only for some users, sometimes I am unable to read the properties of an nt:file in that folder. I tried our code against Jackrabbit 2.2-SNAPSHOT and it worked fine. I tried to find out what change fixes the bug, and it appears to be r950440. Are there plans to merge this into the 2.1 branch (I just saw it was merged to 2.0).",
