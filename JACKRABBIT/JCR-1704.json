    "description": "Indexing rules are supposed to be inherited by children node types.\nIn org.apache.jackrabbit.core.query.lucene.IndexingConfigurationImpl.init, rules are registered for the declared node type and all its children. However, as the rule's node type is still the original one, the rule gets rejected in org.apache.jackrabbit.core.query.lucene.IndexingConfigurationImpl$IndexingRule.appliesTo.\n\nOne simple solution would be to register not the original rule, but a copy where the original node type has been replaced by the child one.\n\nPlease find corrected class attached.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSt\u00e9phane",
