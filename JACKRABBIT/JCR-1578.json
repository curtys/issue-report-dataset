The reason why\nthe tests only fail occasionally is that currently the ordering of the\nstring array returned by getAccessibleWorkspaceNames() is not\ndeterministic.\n\nI can work around the issue by making\nRepositoryImpl.getWorkspaceNames() explicitly sort the returned array\nof names, but a more proper fix would probably be to ensure that the\nworkspace selected by UpdateTest is useful for the test.\n\n\n",
