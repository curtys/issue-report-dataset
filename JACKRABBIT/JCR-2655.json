Imho this issue is still a blocker for 1.6 branch.\nWould it be possible to backport the fix?\n\nAlso the fix in 2.2.0 seems to be just working around the problem, but not attempting to fix already corrupted version history. Is there a way to fix this problem by removing the invalid versions?\n\nThanks.",

I have now backported the fix to the 2.1 and 2.0 branches (see revisions 1174686 and 1174688). I would recommend upgrading to 2.x since we're in any case about to declare the end of life of the 1.6 branch after the next patch release.\n\n> Also the fix in 2.2.0 seems to be just working around the problem, but\n> not attempting to fix already corrupted version history.
