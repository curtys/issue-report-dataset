The duplicate nodes are nodes which the quering session have no permissions and  the returned node is a duplicate of the last returned node where the session can read. It is a bit confusing to explain and my english is poor.\n\nIf the query is done by a \"super user\" session, the returned nodes are the good nodes. If the query is performed by a \"limited user\" session, the number of returned nodes are the same (amazing!!), but the \"forbidden\" nodes are not returned (of course) and these nodes are \"filled\" with the other readed nodes.",

After executing a query and get back the RowIterator from the result, if I call rowiterator.getSize, it will return the size of all nodes matching my query (without honoring the access control) . But if I iterate through the result, I find lots of duplicates in the results; and if I filter out those duplicate, the final result is quite off the original number from RowIteartor.getSize()\n\nBTW, I also disabled Doc Order sorting.\n\n ",
