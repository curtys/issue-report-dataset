Text.encodeIllegalXMLCharacters is static, what is the gain of adding a non-static method to call a static one?\n\nIt needs to be non-static to that classes that extend from the DefaultHighLighter can override it.\n\n> What is the benefit of making methods non static?\n\nSo that they can call the other methods I made non-static for the reason above :-) ",
