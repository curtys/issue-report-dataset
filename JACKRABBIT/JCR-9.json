    "description": "Version interface is implemented (on the frontend) by the VersionImpl class (extending NodeWrapper), which delegates to an internal NodeImpl class, which in turn extends ItemImpl.\n\nSay you have :\n      Node node = // at Version 1.0\n      Version version = // retrieved as 1.0 for the node\n      Version baseVersion = node.getBaseVersion()\n\nYou now expect\n      baseVersion.isSame(version)\neven if\n      baseVersion != version\n\nThis fails, because VersionImpl delegates the isSame call to its delegatee, thus above call becomes\n      ((VersionImpl) baseVersion).delegatee.isSame(version)\nwhere this method is implemented by the ItemImpl class from which the delegatee NodeImpl extends.\n\nThat latter implementation ItemImpl.isSame() only returns true if the other is an ItemImpl, too. But this is not the case because VersionImpl is a Version, NodeWrapper, Node but not an ItemImpl.\n\nProbably the best solution would be for NodeImpl.isSame() to check whether the otherItem is a NodeWrapper und use ((NodeWrapper) otherItem).delegatee as the otherItem for the delegatee call.\n\nOn another track: ItemImpl.isSame() should probably do a fast check whether the otherItem is actually the same instance to prevent type checks...",
