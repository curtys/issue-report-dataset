    "description": "The WebDAV Litmus test suite contains a test case for writing and reading the Unicode character &#x10000; which can't be represented as a single 16-bit char in Java. Instead the character is stored as a surrogate pair of two 16-bit chars. Unfortunately the Xalan XML serializer used by Sun JRE 1.5 incorrectly encodes these as two separate characters in UTF-8, which leads to the following Litmus test failure:\n\n-> running `props':\n[...]\n17. prophighunicode....... pass\n18. propget............... FAIL (PROPFIND on `/default/litmus/prop2': XML parse error at line 1: not well-formed (invalid token))\n",
