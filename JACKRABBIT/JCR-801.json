    "description": "There should be a way to configure the test cases in a way such that NodeTest.java can pass although the repository implementation does not support multiple workspaces.\n\nThe cleanest approach probably would be to allow javax.jcr.tck.workspacename to stay undefined, and to skip the tests in that case. Alternatives would be a special name indicating lack of support for other workspaces, or an additional config variable.\n\n",
