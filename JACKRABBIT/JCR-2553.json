    "description": "the spi2davex batch implementation fails upon creation/modification of all property types that have their value sent as\nseparate stringpart or binarypart AND contain non-ascii characters in their property name.\n\nfrom what i've seen this is due to a limitation in HttpClient 3.x Part#sendDispositionHeader that always writes the part name\nas ascii-bytes. in a related discussion [1] specification compliance and usability were addressed.\n\nlooking at the server-side part revealed that org.apache.commons.fileupload.FileUploadBase#FileItemIteratorImpl\nis prepared to receive non-ascii characters in a header value.\na simple test also showed that curl is perfectly able to send utf-8 part names.\n\nbased on this information and given the fact that spi2dav and the server-sided part are intended to communicate\nwith one other rather than with any kind of custom clients, i suggest to add a simple fix by patching the parts used\nwithin spi2davex.\n\nbtw: in HttpClient 4.x there seems to be a workaround for this problem [2]\n\n[1] http://www.mail-archive.com/httpclient-dev@jakarta.apache.org/msg04637.html\n[2] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HTTPCLIENT-293",
