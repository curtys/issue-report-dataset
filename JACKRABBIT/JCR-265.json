    "description": "I'm having problems with text filter service. I built the contrib/textfilters package and I included the resulting jackrabbit-textfilters-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar in my application classpath. The problem is that TextFilterService class is unable to find any filters, even though that a services/org...TextFilterService file is wihin the META-INF jar's directory.\n\nI think that this must to be with Eclipse RCP classloader mechanism, but the fact is that it does not work. I find a little bit strange this way to load services, and as you can see, it seems problematic in some scenarios.\n\n----\n\nMarcel Reutegger \t\n<marcel.reutegger@gmx.net> to jackrabbit-dev\n\t More options\t  11:01 am (55 minutes ago)\nHi Martin,\n\nwe had a similar problem with the query languages, but I solved that one\nby telling the registry to use a specific classloader. this seemed to work.\nI'm not sure this will also work for the text filters, because the jar\nfile might be in another classloader.\n\ncould you please post a jira bug? I'll then change the discovery\nmechanism to use good old xml config ;)\n",
