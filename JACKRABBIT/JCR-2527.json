    "description": "the credentials retrieved from UserImpl and used to validate the simplecredentials passed to the repository login is overly complex\nand buggy as it tries to match all kind credentials variants with and without hashed password.\nin particular it contains the following problems:\n- simplecredentials containing the hashed pw are considered valid\n- passwords startign with {something} cause inconsistencies and may even prevent the user from login\n\nit should be improved as follows:\n- simplecredentials are always expected to contain the plain text password both for creation and\n  comparison with the cryptedsimplecredentials.\n- creating cryptedsimplecredentials from uid/pw however is left unchanged: the specified pw is\n  hashed with the default algorithm if it turns out not to be in the hashed format.\n- in addition the pw should also be hashed if it has the form {something}whatever but something\n  is an invalid algorithm.\n",
