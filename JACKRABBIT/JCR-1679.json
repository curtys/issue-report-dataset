    "description": "Using a default repository named \"default\" for example, creating a directory named \"default\" in that repository will have issues.  The directory will not behave correctly. \n\nViewing the dir in Jetty http://localhost:8080/jackrabbit/repository/default/default/ will show the contents of the \"default\" directory.  However, clicking on any of the contents will go to an incorrect URL.  E.g. if a directory named \"test\" was created, then the URL for test will be \"http://localhost:8080/jackrabbit/repository/default/test/\"  instead of \"http://localhost:8080/jackrabbit/repository/default/default/test/\".\n\nNotice that there is only one \"default\" in the path provided by jackrabbit.  \n\nThis causes the contents of such directories to be inaccessible",
