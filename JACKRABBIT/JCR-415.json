This covers just a part of this issue, but should simplify further work considerably.\n\nThe attached patch (jackrabbit-extractor-r420472.patch) contains just the TextExtractor interface and related classes placed in org.apache.jackrabbit.extractor. I chose to place them outside of o.a.j.core as they have no Jackrabbit dependencies, and would probably make a good contribution to Apache Lucene once battle-tested.\n\nI'll continue with a separate patch that backwards-compatibly replaces the current TextFilter usage in o.a.j.core.query[.lucene], and with some class diagrams that give a quick overview before diving into the javadocs.",

See http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCR-264.\n\nI think it would make more design sense to try to postpone the creation of the Document instances instead of delaying text extraction. But I'm not too familiar with the details, so I'm OK with adding lazy reading to the mix. In any case I think it's best to layer the lazy reading on top of the TextExtractor interface instead of below it. A utility class like the following could achieve this as long as the given InputStream remains valid until the document has been read.\n\n    class TextExtractorReader extends Reader {\n\n        private final TextExtractor extractor;\n        private final InputStream stream;\n        private final String type;\n        private final String encoding;\n\n        private Reader reader;\n\n        public TextExtractorReader(\n                TextExtractor extractor, InputStream stream,\n                String type, String encoding) {\n            this.extractor = extractor;\n            this.stream = stream;\n            this.type = type;\n            this.encoding = encoding;\n            this.reader = null;\n        }\n\n        public int read(char[] buffer, int offset, int length) throws IOException {\n            if (reader == null) {\n                reader = extractor.extractText(stream, type, encoding);\n            }\n            return reader.read(buffer, offset, length);\n        }\n\n        public void close() throws IOException {\n            if (reader != null) {\n                reader.close();\n            } else {\n                stream.close();\n            }\n        }\n\n    }\n\nI can update the query patch accordingly.\n",

I thought I could get away with the dirty solution ;)\nWhile going through your patch I was actually also thinking about a design that should create the document\nonly when it is really added to the index.\nFor now we can maybe use the TextExtractorReader you proposed and then in a next step change the design\nto create the Document in a later stage of the indexing process.",

Jackrabbit would still support existing releases of jackrabbit-text-filters but the interface TextFilter will be deprecated (see Jukkas' patch) and developers are encouraged to use the new TextExtractor interface.\n\nDoes this make sense?",

    "description": "Indexing of binary content should be enhanced in order to allow either configuration what fields are indexed or provide better support for custom NodeIndexer implementations.\n\nThe current design has a couple of flaws that should be addressed at the same time:\n- Reader instances are requested from the text filters even though the reader might never be used\n- only jcr:data properties of nt:resource nodes are fulltext indexed\n- It is up to the text filter implementation to decide the lucene field name for the text representation, responsibility should be moved to the NodeIndexer. A text filter should only provide a Reader instance.\n\nWith those changes a custom NodeIndexer can then decide if a binary property has one or more representations in the index.",
