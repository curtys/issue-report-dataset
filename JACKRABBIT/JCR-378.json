    "description": "Reported by Martin Perez:\n\nBut I found a bug on the .war file. It is missing the slf4j-log4j12-1.0.jar. It's in someway tricky to detect it because if you do not include it a ClassNotFoundException will be thrown but poiting to the JCR class with the log statement. Anyways, if you include the .jar file on the WEB-INF/lib directory, then the exception goes to exception's hell.\n\n",
