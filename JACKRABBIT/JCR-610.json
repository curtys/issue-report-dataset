Passes all unit tests and seems to work fine with existing repositories, so likely no manual upgrade steps are required.\n\nThere are some improvements in the Derby 10.2 disk layout that are by default not enabled when using a database created with 10.1. To get full benefits in 10.2, one needs to include the \"upgrade=true\" attribute in the JDBC connection string. I'll probably include a note about this in the Jackrabbit 1.2 release notes.",
