    "description": "The RepositoryLock opens a RandomAccessFile, but does not close it. The problematic line is:\n\nlock = new RandomAccessFile(file, \"rw\").getChannel().tryLock();\n\nThis is usually not a problem as the file will be closed when the RandomAccessFile object is garbage collected. However, if called a lot in a short time frame, this results in 'too many open files' in some environments (for example Linux). ",
