Roy, is there a list of licenses that are compatible with the apache license? Just to make sure we don't spend too much time in the future for extensions that we cannot include. Thanks.\n\nWould it be ok with you Martin, to remove the HTML filter from the patch? The XML and RTF filters are still very good contributions that I'd like to include.",
