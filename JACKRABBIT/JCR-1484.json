The specification however says:\n\n<quote>\nSome level 2 implementations may only return properties that have been\nsaved (in a transactional setting this includes both those properties\nthat have been saved but not yet committed, as well as properties that\nhave been committed). Other level 2 implementations may additionally\nreturn properties that have been added within the current Session but are\nnot yet saved.\n</quote>\n\nJackrabbit does not support the latter, but at least has to support the first.",
