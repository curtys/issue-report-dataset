The Jackrabbit version number should probably be included in the DTD URL, and we could release the DTDs either on jackrabbit.apache.org (assuming they won't be repeatedly requested by Jackrabbit installations or other tools without manual confirmation), on the Apache release mirrors, or on the Maven repositories.\n",

Just say and it'll be done.\n\nI assumed that the file will be visible under  http://jackrabbit.apache.org/1.1/repository.dtd and I find it the most natural choice. About access to this file - I think that editor tools like Eclipse will want to access it in order to support code completion and so on but it should not cause bandwidth problems if that was your case.\n",

The published DTD does not yet contain the JCR-202 changes, I'll add them separately.\n\nThere's also an earlier DTD at http://jackrabbit.apache.org/dtd/repository-1.0.dtd that documents the configuration format of Jackrabbit 1.0 and 1.1. Note that Jackrabbit 1.2 will still be fully backwards compatible with configurations that use the 1.0 dtd.\n",

    "description": "Hello!\n\nHere at Cognifide, Przemo and I we got a bit confused while trying to solve JCR-202. There was a need to modify repository.xml configuration file and it's DTD, and we have found that there are different repository.xml files within trunk that differs this definition. I think that it is a good idea to extract this definition to a one separate file (and maybe .xsd instead of .dtd) and then link it in other files. It would be also nice to put this file somewhere on the Web and reference it via URL.\n\nI am waiting for your comments.\n\nRegards, Jan",
