Method implemented in BundleDB PM to ensure that blob resources are removed from underlying blobstore.\n\nNot sure if something needs to be done in BundleFS PM, so method remains empty there.\n",

            "body": "This seems more complex than expected. There is already an existing \"remove property\" code path based on BLOBFileValue.remove(), but that doesn't work correctly for database persistence with externalBLOBs set to false because the BLOBFileValue.remove() call ends up removing the temporary copy of the value instead of the actual database row.\n\nInstead of adding a new code path for handling database persistence, I'd rather have a way that hooks the required functionality to the existing code path.\n\nAlso, this issue might get obsoleted with the new data store feature.\n\nThus, I'm removing this issue from the 1.3.2 roadmap.",
