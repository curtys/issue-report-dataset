According to the XPath 2.0 syntax there are no entity references needed in string literals:\n\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20/#prod-xpath-StringLiteral\n\nJackrabbit uses a XQuery parser because of the order by extension defined in JSR 170 and there you need to encode the ampersand.\n\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/xquery/#doc-xquery-StringLiteral\n\nSeems like the XQuery is not really a super set of XPath, even though it claims to be an extension to XPath.",

Thus we can't use a standard XQuery parser out of the box. Seems we need to hack it, or use an XPath parser and extract the orderby stuff before parsing.\n",

This is because Jackrabbit uses an XQuery parser where a string literal is slightly more constraint than in XPath.\n\nExample:\n\n//element(*, nt:base)[jcr:contains(., 'max&moritz')]\n\nthrows a parse exception. Instead the parser should simply recognize the ampersand as regular character.",
