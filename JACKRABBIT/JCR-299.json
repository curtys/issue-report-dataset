            "body": "Fixed in revision 423547 by catching and logging all index filter exceptions (even unchecked ones). After considering this issue I don't think it makes sense to give the index filters veto powers over saving content. They are not validators, so if a binary property cannot be parsed for text content because of a file format error or some similar problem, the indexer should return an empty reader instead of trying to revert the save or somehow signal the client application.\n\nThe requested functionality would be better implemented by extending the value constraint support in Jackrabbit. Please file a separate feature request if you still need this functionality.",
