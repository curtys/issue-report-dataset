    "description": "(as discussed on mailing list)\n\nas the implementation of the new features for jsr283 have started, i\nsuggest to put the new jsr283 interfaces to jackrabbit-api instead to\ncore (where possible). this way, we can already figure out\ninter-module dependency issues and people can start using experimental\nfeatures through an API than rather through casting objects to core\ninterfaces.\n\nsuggestion: use 'org.apache.jackrabbit.api.jsr283' as base package for\nthe new jsr283 interfaces and classes.\n\nfor example, use\norg.apache.jackrabbit.api.jsr283.nodetype.NodeDefinitionTemplate\nfor the future javax.jcr.nodetype.NodeDefinitionTemplate\n\nonce jcr2.0 is released, we will drop the interim interfaces.\n\n",
