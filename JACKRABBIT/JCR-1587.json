            "body": "The sequence of checking the various places where an ItemState can reside is not correct in XAItemStateManager.\n\nE.g. in getItemState() first checks the transaction change log if it contains an item. If the item is not known to the change log the base class (LocalItemStateManager) is called. This means the change logs and item state managers are checked in the following sequence:\n\n1) transaction change log\n2) local change log\n3) shared item state manager\n\nThis is actually wrong and should rather be:\n\n1) local change log\n2) transaction change log\n3) shared item state manager\n\nThe test fails because the property for the version label \"2\" is marked deleted in the transaction change log, while at the same time is added in the local change log. Because the sequence of the checks is wrong, the version label property is incorrectly reported as destroyed.",
