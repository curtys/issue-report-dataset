            "body": "you beat me to it :)\nI was still testing out some cache changes.\n\nmy 2 cents:\n - Cache change: getHitCount / getMissCount . I'd drop hitCount as the cache already logs accessCount (hitCount = accessCount - hitCount, you don't need to store this info on the cache)\n                         putCount : it *should* follow a missCount. is is really necessary? \nWhat I'm adding to the stats is the time is takes to recover from a cache miss, but that is component based. Let's say a PersistenceManager impl has a cache miss, and it loads the info from an external storage: you have access +1, miss +1 at the cache level (I don't need put / hit), also I'll compute the cache miss time locally on the PersistenceManager impl.\n\nAlso, an AbstractCache can have only one CacheAccessListener. I'm looking at the AbstractBundlePersistenceManager which is now also a CacheAccessListener, that doesn't feel 100% right to me. What do you say about using the Stats object as a dedicated PM cache listener, and there you could also log this info.\n\nAs I said the code I'm working on is not committed yet, as I'm still testing, but we can definitely unite our efforts. You can follow up with the changes on the dedicated JMX JR branch [0], if that is something you would be interested in. And we'll merge back to trunk soon enough. \n\nOverall I agree with the need to have more info on the caches, but this is a really sensitive area, any change must be tested carefully.\n\nps. what is also missing from the cache info now is a cache miss reason: cold cache - the entry was not there which would be no real reason to worry, or the entry has been evicted previously which would probably indicate a low memory setting must be adjusted.\n\n[0] http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/branches/JCR-2936/",

            "body": "Hi Alex,\n\nThanks for the feedback.\n\nThe following statement is not correct for the current implementation: \"hitCount = accessCount - hitCount\". The access count is used for resizing the caches (in resizeAll) and reset every second or so. I didn't want to mess with the resizing allogrithm which need this reset. What is true is that the \"total accessCount\" is the hitCount plus the missCount ;-)\n\nThe AbstractBundlePersistenceManager creates a new ConcurrentCache so this can have it's own CacheListener. I'm not sure if we would need more than one listener for each cache. If there is such a need we should either allow for that or indeed create a CacheStats object that can contain information about all the caches. It could be more \"elegant\" to defer all stats to a separate CacheStats object. On advantage of the current implementation is that you can \"choose\" which cache stats you want to have logged by setting the appropriate classes to info logging.\n\nI don't see an easy way without creating some overhead to get the cache miss reason. That would require some \"shadow\" index which contains removed ids that have not yet been re-cached. It would at least involve an extra check while fetching an item from the cache. And you have to figure out what to do with deleted items so it doesn't definitively grows. \n\nI'm *very* interested in the JMX effort that is going on (we already use JMX to get all kind of other info in our monitoring system). I consider the logging and collecting of the stats as a first step before exposing the stats over JMX.  I'll have a look at the branch and try to also make that next step ;-)\n \nBart\n\n\n",

In the beginning it wasn't very clear to me, also a lack of community feedback didn't make the choice easier ;)\nNow Stats and JMX are 2 different things, but the effort is combined on the branch I mentioned.\n\nGiven that we agree on the direction of the patch, we can apply it on the jmx branch, and we can continue there the dev. \nThis will also allow others to chime in with some feedback before we merge to trunk.\n\nI don't think I have time today, but I have to push some code related to it soon, and I could merge your changes beforehand.\nWhat do you think?\n",

For example, on the patch, the AbstractBundlePersistenceManager never calls reset. \n\nYep. The reset call is only needed for correctly calculating the new cache sizes that are managed by the CacheManager. The BundleCaches are not managed by the CacheManager and \"just\" use the ConcurrentCache.\n\n> What we could do is to only update the hitCount when the cache listeners are called, this way we'll increase once every CacheAccessListener#ACCESS_INTERVAL (127) calls. The stats can be a bit behind, that should not be a problem. \n\nI would only go for such \"optimizations\" if there is a need for it. Afaik the AtomicLong.incrementAndGet() should be \"fast enough\". If not, we can always have a look what the exact bottleneck is and optimize for that. For now it feels like it would only make things more complex. \n\n> About the element count: I feel we could leverage AbstractCache#recordSizeChange(), it appears that when it is called with a pozitive value it's an add, otherwise it's a remove. \n\nAh, I missed that one. It would fit the \"pattern\" of the other stats. Otoh, the number of segments is coupled to the number of CPUs (did somebody actually benchmark if that's optiomal?) and looping over the segments should be pretty cheap.\n\n> I wasn't talking about a dedicated CacheStats object either. I'm working on a dedicated PersistenceManagerStat that also contains some cache info. I agree about being able to tune the logging for a dedicated cache. \n(I'm also looking to add average cache miss duration on the PM. This is also something to watch out for.) \n\nI don't think the cache miss duration is of much interest, but the time it takes to load a bundle when the cache is missed certainly is ;-) (it's however not a statistic of the cache in the pure sense)\n\n> Given that we agree on the direction of the patch, we can apply it on the jmx branch, and we can continue there the dev.

What do you think? \n\nThat would be great! I hope to have some cycles to look at the branch in the next few days and see if we can expose the stats through JMX.\n\nBart\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Not sure if that's happening anywhere in the code though. It's not really a very important stat.\n\n>  - cache manager logging to debug instead on info \nThe reason why I logged it on info is to make a difference between the resize log messages (which happen every second and are quite verbose) and the stats logging which only happens once a minute by default. The \"old\" JR 1.x bundlecache logging was also set on INFO.\n\n> The AbstractBundlePersistenceManager stuff will come at a later time, along with a dedicated stats object. \nThat was the reason I actually created the patch ;-) The bundleCache tuning is critical for getting the optimal performance in our web based (mostly read) environments. Registering the PM as listener itself isn't the most beautiful solution I agree. For trunk we should find a better way and avoid duplicating the \"log only once so often\" code. Probably with some kind of CacheStats(Manager). For 2.2 it might the easiest route to just register the listener, but maybe not the best. I guess that will depend on the impact of the dedicated stats object on 2.2?\n\nAnyway, I would love to see this in 2.2 as well!\n\nSome very minor things: \n- shouldn't we move the  totalAccessCount.incrementAndGet(); in the recordCacheAccess() to the beginning of the method?\n- for really easy log parsing it could make sense to remove the spaces in the log output, e.g. \"Cache name\" -> \"cachename\", \"used memory\" -> \"usedmemorykb\", \"max memory\" -> \"maxmemorykb\" \n\n",
