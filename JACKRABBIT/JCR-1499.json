There the ConnectionRecoveryManager is closed, which tries to operate on a connection to the already shut down derby database. The log contains entries like:\n\n25.03.2008 13:49:29 *ERROR* [Thread-5] ConnectionRecoveryManager: failed to close connection, reason: No current connection., state/code: 08003/40000 (ConnectionRecoveryManager.java, line 453)",
