As long as we don't have that I think we either have to live with the current test or remove it entirely. IMO instantiating a full blown server for the factory test would make the test run way to slow. What we could try to do is to put up a mock server instead of the full blown server. WDYT?\n\nOTOH there is also JCR-2362. If we are going to remove the jcr-client module entirely I think we shouldn't bother too much. \n\n",
