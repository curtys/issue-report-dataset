The code after the try-catch-finally block expects the read lock to still be acquired, so releasing it in the catch block before throwing an exception was OK, but not in the finally block. This of course still leaves open the question of what to do with unexpected RuntimeExceptions.\n\nI'm reverting this change and hope to fix this together with JCR-546.",
