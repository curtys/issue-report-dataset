    "description": "Some BeanConverters are not yet stable. We have to add more unit tests.  It seems that null values for bean attributes are not well supported. We have to test that for all BeanConverters. \n\nHere is a good scenario to test : \n\nModel : Class A contains an attribute \"b\" based on class B. \n\nCreate an instance of A with \"b\" = null\ninsert A / save\nGet instance of A\nset the attribute of B\nupdate A /save\n\n\n\n\n",
