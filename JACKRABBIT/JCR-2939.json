    "description": "This is the original issue:\n----------\nI tried to get the childnodes of a node names \"/a b\" using the following code\n  QueryManager queryManager=session.getWorkspace().getQueryManager();\n  QueryObjectModelFactory qomf=queryManager.getQOMFactory();\n  Source source1=qomf.selector(NodeType.NT_BASE, \"selector_0\");\n  Column[] columns = new Column[]{qomf.column(\"selector_0\", null, null)};\n  Constraint constraint2 = qomf.childNode(\"selector_0\", \"/a b\");\n  QueryObjectModel qom = qomf.createQuery(source1, constraint2 , null, columns);\n\nThis is not giving any result when the session is acquired through webdav. But when connected using JNDI it is giving the child nodes. \n\nThe sql statement getting created is \nSELECT selector_0.* FROM [nt:base] AS selector_0 WHERE ISCHILDNODE(selector_0, \n[/a b]).\n\nWhen using webdav If i give this SQL2 query directly along with quotes around \nthe path i.e. ['/a b'] then it is working as expected.\n----------\n\nthis doesn't have anything to do with webdav. the problem is the QueryObjectModel generates an SQL2 query that is not 100% equivalent, it fails to escape paths that have spaces in them.\nthis way, in the case of davex remoting, the jr client will use the statement generated instead, which is not escaped, and will fail to return the expected nodes. \n\nThis can be seen easily if we do a System.out.println(qom.getStatement())\n\n\n",
