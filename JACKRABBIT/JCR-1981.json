As such it explicitly belongs to src/main/java.\n\nHowever, I haven't seen anyone really use the class and I'm not sure how well it even works anymore. So perhaps we should simply drop the entire class.\n\nAnyway, I changed this to an improvement issue, as the class being in src/main/java was not a mistake.",
