Since SPI implementations almost always depend on jcr-commons anyway, moving the parser might be a good idea. \n\nHowever, the different representations of Names, Types etc would have to be factored out. Currently the parser uses builders for constructing the types (QNodeDefinitionBuilder, QNodeTypeDefinitionBuilder, QPropertyDefinitionBuilder). These would need to be generalized. Both jcr-commons and spi-commons need to provide their specific versions for these builders. ",

It would directly implement the JCR 2.0 NodeTypeDefinition + NodeTypeTemplate et al. classes and instantiate them. For parsing valid names, it could directly use the session's getNamespaceUri and getNamespacePrefix methods, without using spi's flexible NameResolver mechanism.\n\nAny problem that I missed?",

So I suggest to split the parser into a front end for lexical/syntactical analysis and a back end for generating the specific representation. AFAIR the split is more or less there already (see usage of QNodeDefinitionBuilder, QNodeTypeDefinitionBuilder, QPropertyDefinitionBuilder). Only the back ends would have to be factored out. ",

That way the parser in spi-commons can be optimized for the spi use case, and the one in jcr-commons is as simple as possible.",

I think moving all those QNode* classes over to jcr-commons is really a bit of overkill, if you can get them simply via NodeTypeManager.createNodeTypeTemplate() et al.\n\nOtherwise I think one could share the lexer and an abstract base class for CND reading that operates on JCR 2.0 NodeTypeTemplate interfaces (and gets them from an abstract method createNodeTypeTemplate(), same for node defs and property defs). If this will be used by spi-commons as well, it would be forced to have QNode* to extend from the new JCR 2.0 templates. Or one would provide yet another wrapper that implements both *Template and QNode* interfaces, internal to the spi cnd parser.",

I suggest to change things along the line of\n\nclass CompactNodeTypeDefReader {...} \nto \nclass CompactNodeTypeDefReader<T> {...}\n\nThe constructor which now takes a QNodeTypeDefinitionsBuilder would then take a NodeTypeDefinitionsBuilder<T> and getNodeTypeDefinitions() would return List<T>. \n\nLike this jcr-commons and spi-commons both need to provide a builder which can be used with the parser. The parser itself can be reused amongst both modules. \n",

Although it adds some complexity (in particular AbstractItemTypeDefinitionsBuilder and its implementations), it adds a great deal of flexibility. Also that way, changes to client code is minimal. \n\nWith the proposed patch it is quite easy to parametrize the parser such that it generates a JCR 2.0 API *Template bases representation of the CND. Just implement an AbstractItemTypeDefinitionsBuilder<NodeTypeTemplate, N...> and pass it to CompactNodeTypeDefReader's constructor. \n\nAlso note that the parser is currently used to create two different representations of the CND (one in core, another in spi). AFAIU you want to use it to create yet another representation (JCR API node types/templates). Therefore I think it doesn't make sense to move the parser close to one specific representation. BTW it was moved from core to spi already (JCR-1516) because we then thought the spi representation would be the more general one. ",
