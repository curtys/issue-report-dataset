This is not user friendly. Instead, stopScan() should be optional, and should be allowed any time. It may be used to indicate garbage collection has finished:\n\ntry {\n  gc.scan();\n  ...\n  gc.deleteUnused();\n} finally {\n  gc.stopScan();\n}\n\nOr when sharing the repository:\n\ngc1.scan();\ngc2.scan();\ngc1.deleteUnused();\ngc2.stopScan();\n",
