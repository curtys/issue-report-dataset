            "body": "apart from discussing the interfaces, we may take a look at the implications of Path/Name interfaces.\nI could see the followings issues that we need to get a consensus about:\n\n- Would it be an option to change the derived interfaces in jackrabbit-jcr-commons in order to use the Name/Path\n  interfaces instead of QName/Path classes. I think of\n   - NamespaceResolver\n   - NameCache\n   - PathCache\n\n- The same question arises for \n   - NameFormat\n   - PathFormat\n\nSince both the 'core' and the various modules in the spi contrib make use of the mentioned functionality present in jackrabbit-jcr-commons, i think this issue should be discussed on a broader basis. \n\nCopying the utilities to the SPI-commons just in order to be able the change them doesn't seem a sensible solution to me.\n\n",

I'd like to go further to a design where the SPI client wouldn't necessarily need to parse the names and paths before passing them down to the SPI implementation, but this is already a good step forward and it's probably best not to overlay such design changes on top of the proposed restructuring.",
