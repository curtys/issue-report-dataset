Once this is done the old files should be removed.\n\nproject.xml needs patching to change to Jackrabbit 1.3.1 and add a new dependency because Jackrabbit is now split up differently than it was in 1.1.  The Berkeley DB version was also updated to the latest available for download.\n\nOnce applied bdb-persistence is no longer compatible with Jackrabbit 1.1 or older.  It *might* be compatible with versions between 1.1 and 1.3.1 but I have only tested with 1.3.1.",
