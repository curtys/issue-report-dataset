In JDK, that one has a known issue not processing namespace prefix mappings properly (will attach a separate test case).\n\nProposals:\n\n- drop JDK 1.4 support\n- tune the JCR2SPI handler to create namespace attributes when needed\n- use an entirely different serializer\n\nMy personal preference would be just to drop JDK 1.4 support, but that may not be acceptable for everyone.\n",
