This will be changed to application/msexcel.\nAlso problems makes the new office 07 format (docx,xlsx,pptx). They will also be changed to application/octet-stream (default mimetype).\nWe have a lot of file types that we store in jackrabbit that are not in the properties file (MSInfoPath-, OutlookMsg-, MsAccess-Files, ...)\nI think it will be better to let the mimetype property untouched if a mimetype is present so we must not put all the possible mimetypes in the property file.\n\nBR\nclaus",
