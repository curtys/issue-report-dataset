Because although in RepositoryImpl's constructor it is asserted true in case the data store config is not null, in InternalValue it's used regardless of the case. So if the data store is not configured but the property is true (which is it's default value) then the processing in InternalValue is wrong. IMHO, this property should be removed altogether.\nRegards",

            "body": "Hi Esteban,\n\nThe system property org.jackrabbit.useDataStore is a 'kill switch' to disable the new code in InternalValue and do everything as before (not using BLOBInMemory and so on). This property should never be switched off, except if there is a problem with the data store, and you want to check if the new code is to blame. I don't think it is needed any longer, I will remove this property (and the old code) in the trunk.",
