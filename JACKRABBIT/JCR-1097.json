I'm not sure about all the implications of this move, so please review.\n\nThe previous o.a.j.core.XASession interface would remain as a deprecated interface that simply extends o.a.j.api.XASession. The existing XASessionImpl would also for now keep implementing the deprectated o.a.j.core.XASession interface instead of the new jackrabbit-api version to avoid backwards compatibility issues.",
