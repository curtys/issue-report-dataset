This class has an instance variable of type org.apache.jackrabbit.core.util.db.ConnectionHelper that it treats as a thread safe object.  However, the batch mode features of this class do not appear to be thread safe.  I have prepared a patch that makes the batch mode features of the ConnectionHelper class by moving its batchConnection into a thread local variable.",

This patch replaces that flag with a thread local variable, so every thread accessing the helper can have its own batch connection.",
