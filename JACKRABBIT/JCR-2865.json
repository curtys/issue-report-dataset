See JCR-2699 for the work I did to streamline the synchronized acquireReadLock() method as much as possible. Currently the method doesn't allocate any new memory or make any structural changes to any data structures, and I'd like to keep it that way until we can come up with a way to avoid synchronization.\n\nThe improved logic in DefaultISMLocking was based on a rather thorough review of the concurrency requirements of the ISMLocking interface. Unfortunately I failed to take into account the fact that the DefaultISMLocking class is also being used directly by the version manager outside the ISMLocking contract. This and the other referenced issues are a result of this.\n\nISM and version locking are really two separate cases with somewhat different requirements, which is why I don't think it's a good idea to use a single class for both cases. I'll go forward and implement the idea I suggested earlier about splitting the class into two different copies.",

You could see below code snippet from the Jackrabbit source. readerCount is the current active reader.\nwritersWaiting++;\nwhile (writerId != null? !isSameThreadId(writerId, currentId) : readerCount > 0) {\n                                wait();\n}\n\n3.\tThread A apply another read lock, then it will wait too, since there is a writer is waiting.  Then a dead lock happens.\nwhile (writerId != null? (writerCount > 0 && !isSameThreadId(writerId, currentId)): writersWaiting > 0) {\n                                wait();\n}\n\nSince the lock in DefaultISMLocking is global lock, so I think if a thread has already hold a reader lock, it could get the reader lock again. I create a fix with this idea.\n",
