I have a draft patch that looks at the namespaces used in the element name and attributes passed to startElement and automatically calls startPrefixMapping for any namespaces that have not yet been declared. This workaround seems to work on 1.4, but I'm getting increasingly worried about the extra stuff we're layering on XML serialization. On the other hand, I guess it's still better than having the explicit Xerces dependency.",

So maybe we should just park this one, and see that we can accelerate getting rid of the requrement to support 1.4.\n\nRelated to this:  the way SerializingContentHandler.getSerializer() currently works seems to cause the \"probe\" happening upon each invocation, which seems to be a very expensive thing to do. As the outcome of the probe only depends on the VM + loaded classes, maybe the result should be held in a static variable?\n\n\n",
