    "description": "The ItemIds returned by spi2dav are currently not stable in the sense that they are sometimes uuid based and sometimes not: If a node is referenceable some of its properties will receive fully path based ids while others will receive ids based on the uuid of its parent node. \n\nThe efficiency of caching introduced with JCR-2498 depends on stable ids. I therefore suggest to improve spi2dav such that property ids are always uuid based if the parent's node has a uuid. ",
