If yes I suggest to assign explicit values, as in:\nint OPERATION_EQ_VALUE = 11;\nint OPERATION_EQ_GENERAL = 12;\n...\nAn alternative would be to use the 'enum pattern' (using singleton objects rather than int constants) but that's more tricky in JDK 1.4 as 'enum' is not supported.\n\nBy the way, the main advantage of int constants (the ability to use switch / case) is never used in the code - if else if else everywhere.",
