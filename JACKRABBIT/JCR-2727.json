            "body": "Thanks for the patch. However, the semantics of AddGroupMembersTest changed: the intent of the original test was to measure the performance of adding many users (thousands) to a group. The changed test measures performance of adding a few users to a group (100). The same applies to CreateUserTest respectively.\n\nI edited the patch to regain the original semantics while preserving your fixes and ran the performance tests:\n\n# AddGroupMembersTest                    min     10%     50%     90%     max\n2.2-btree-usermanager-repository         146     152     189     259     341\n2.2-default-usermanager-repository       789     930    1945    2875    3205\n\n# GroupMemberLookupTest                  min     10%     50%     90%     max\n2.2-btree-usermanager-repository         749     755     766     779    1289\n2.2-default-usermanager-repository      1176    1179    1203    1257    1310\n\n# CreateUserTest                         min     10%     50%     90%     max\n2.2-btree-usermanager-repository        1189    1303    1648    2127    2161\n2.2-default-usermanager-repository      1181    1386    1981    2895    3278\n\n# GroupGetMembersTest                    min     10%     50%     90%     max\n2.2-btree-usermanager-repository           6       6       7      11      87\n2.2-default-usermanager-repository         4       4       5       8      17\n\nI'll commit the edited patch to trunk in a minute.\n\n\n\n",
