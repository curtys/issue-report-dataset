Example :\nbook holds a reference property on its author(s)\nauthors have a name\n\nWe want all books from a specific author :\n\n/jcr:root/element(*, bookType)[jcr:deref(@author, 'authorType')/@name = 'King']\n\nThis fails with an InvalidQueryException currently (not supported).\n\nThe error is raised in the XPathQueryBuilder class, in function : private QueryNode createFunction(SimpleNode node, QueryNode queryNode), in the block :\nelse if (NameFormat.format(JCR_DEREF, resolver).equals(fName))\n\nProblem is that with this query, when evaluating the jcr:deref() function, then in this method at this point, queryNode.getType() is 0 and tests raise the exception if queryNode.getType() is neither QueryNode.TYPE_LOCATION nor QueryNode.TYPE_PATH.\n\nI think this is a useful place to put a deref function in a query, as I don't know how we could test the referenced node properties another way.\n\nFrederic Esnault",
