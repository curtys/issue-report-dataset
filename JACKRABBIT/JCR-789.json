The method you mention does not take a relative path argument but a name pattern and those never have an index.\n\nTobias wrote:\n> - use a 0-based index (when storing as int) throughout the code (also in NodeState)\n\nWhat's the benefit of using a 0-based index when the spec says they are 1-based? Wouldn't that make the implementation more complicated to understand?\n\nIMO the INDEX_UNDEFINED only makes sense in context of an XPath query. If a path element does not have an index in XPath then all same named nodes are selected regardless of what index they have. Whereas in the JCR API Node.getNode(\"foo\") and Node.getNode(\"foo[1]\") is the same.\n\nI think the crucial question is: does the spec says anywhere an 1-index needs to preserved in a path?",
