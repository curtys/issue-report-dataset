An XML element can have a child element and an attribute with the same name while a JCR node cannot have a child node and property with the same name. For example, <a b=\"x\"><b/></a> would imply a JCR node with one property called b and one child node also called b, which is not allowed. Therefore if such a fragment of XML is encountered on import it is an implementation issue as to how to deal with it. \n\n=======================================\n\nso the current behaviour (ItemExistsException) is accordance with the spec \n(\"is an implementation issue as to how to deal with it\").\n\nbut i guess we will have to come up with a way to import such xml fragments\n(e.g. with a child node construct that represents a 'colliding' property,\nsimilar to jcr:xmltext for character data)",
