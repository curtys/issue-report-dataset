    "description": "These test cases assume that an ancestor of a versioned node can be made versioned. This may not be true for all JCR compliant stores.\n\nThere should be a way to skip the test when it can not be executed.\n\nOne obvious approach would be to throw a NotExecutableException when the attempt to enable versioning on the parent fails. However this has the drawback that it can mask configuration errors.\n\nThoughts?\n",
