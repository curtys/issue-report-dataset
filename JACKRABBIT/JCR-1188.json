    "description": "Currently mime type detection is done using the content type header or (if missing) using a static MimeResolver instance in \nthe IOUtil class. The MimeResolver itself reads from a properties file, that obviously does not list all possible extensions and\nmimetypes.\n\nThis could be improved by:\n\n- extending the resource configuration.\n- extend the ImportContext and ExportContext interfaces\n- replacing the current usages of IOUti#MIMERESOLVER by the corresponding calls on the Context classes which \n  themselves get a MimeResolver that is retrieved from the resource configuration.",
