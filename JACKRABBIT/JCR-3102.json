I guess the javadoc is simply outdated and refers back to the initial idea of the root version not having any frozen state. AFAICT the idea of including basic details of the node in the root version came a bit later.\n\n[1] http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=122838\n[2] http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=53784",
