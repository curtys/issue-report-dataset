    "description": "the following test fails with ItemNotFoundException at the indicated position due to the fact that\nthe parent n2 is EXISTING but still not visible to the system session responsible for the ac\nevaluation.\n\npublic void testTransaction() throws Exception {\n\n        // make sure testUser has all privileges\n        Privilege[] privileges = privilegesFromName(Privilege.JCR_ALL);\n        givePrivileges(path, privileges, getRestrictions(superuser, path));\n\n        // create new node and lock it\n        Session s = getTestSession();\n        UserTransaction utx = new UserTransactionImpl(s);\n        utx.begin();\n\n        // add node and save it\n        Node n = s.getNode(childNPath);\n        if (n.hasNode(nodeName1)) {\n            Node c = n.getNode(nodeName1);\n            c.remove();\n            s.save();\n        }\n\n        Node n2 = n.addNode(nodeName1);\n        s.save();\n            \n        Node n3 = n2.addNode(nodeName2);\n        s.save(); // exception\n\n        // commit\n        utx.commit();\n    }\n\nA possible workaround would be to make sure that ItemSaveOperation.persistTransientItems \nretrieves the parent without having the checkPermission enabled since we can assume that\nthe new item could not be added if the parent was not readable in the first place.... but careful\nevaluation would be required.\n\nNOTE: this is just one example of the AC-evaluation not properly dealing with XA transactions.\nI am convinced that other examples could be find....\n",
