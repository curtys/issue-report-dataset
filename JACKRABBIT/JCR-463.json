IMO a better patch should bind the xaresource lifecylcle to the tx only if the session was logged out inside the tx.

I consider that we must check, before closing session, if this session is binded to a transaction. In this situation the session mustn't be closed: transaction  will close it.\n\n    public void logout() {\n    \tif (!mc.getManagedConnectionFactory().getBindSessionToTrasaction().booleanValue()) {\n    \t\tmc.closeHandle(this);\n    \t}\n    }\n\nFor example this is very important when we use spring, springmodules (jcr module) and jackrabbit because the springmodules library closes session when local transaction finishes. And if the session is closed by transaction a exception is throwed.\n\nThanks",
