    "description": "Workspace copy works fine for everything else but if you copy a hierarchy which contains binary properties\nand remove the source after copying it removes the binary from \"copied\" newly created hierarchy as well.\n\nHow to reproduce:\n\n1. create hierarchy with any type of nodes  - /site / en / image [Type Binary]\n2. create another hierarchy at different level - /site2\n3. copy /site/en under /site2\n-- till now everything is fine, its a proper copy and if you export xml out of these 2 hierarchies you will see that \"image\" is actually copied\n4. now delete /site/en\n5. you will see all other properties as copied before /site2/en... except binary.\n\nare binary types are always referenced? even if you copy via workspace copy\n",
