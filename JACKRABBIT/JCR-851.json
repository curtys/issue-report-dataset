Thus a reasonable SPI implementation would stream (large) binaries to the backend server already during QValueFactory.create(InputStream) and use internal of identifiers to keep track of the values.\n\nJust like with the normal JCR ValueFactory interface, the most reasonable implementation is to consume the entire InputStream when the create() method is called instead of lazily keeping just the reference.",

What kind of an alternative contract do you have in mind?\n\nAFAIUI it never makes sense to have (large) binaries associated directly with the QValue instances. They should always be stored on the server-side and the QValue instance should only hold a reference or identifier to the backend storage. Calling getStream() will request the binary to be streamed from the backend. This solution should cover both reading and writing of values pretty well.",

The SPI implementation obviously creates QValues whenever content is read, but I don't believe that is a problem in this case.",

Supporting multiple calls to getStream() is simple for multiple reads, but not for the case where a property is set and then re-read (such as in some of the TCK tests).\n\nOne solution to that would be to:\n\n- require getStream() to *either* return a new stream instance, or to throw an IllegalStateException, and\n- modify JCR2SPI to obtain a new QValue if getStream() on the cached value yielded that exception.\n\nThat would allow JCR2SPI to keep QValue instances in most cases (read/read), but would make it much simpler to implement the write/read sequence.\n",

In this case, I can preserve the contents of the stream either in memory or on disk.\n\nThe write to repository case theoretically can be optimized: the InputStream held by the QValue would be replaced with the information required to get the contents from the backing store later on. However, this assumes that the write operation will succeed. It also doesn't take care of the case where the binary property in the repository later on gets replaced by a new value, in which case the information in the QValue object would become invalid.\n\nHint: if you feel the current interface is good enough, please propose a change to SPI2JCR that implements QValue.getStream without making a copy of the contents...\n\nBest regards, Julian\n",
