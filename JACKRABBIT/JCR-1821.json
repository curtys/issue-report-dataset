    "description": "julian detected an issue with jcr2spi that was previously shadowed due to heavy reloading of items upon save.\nwith the most recent changes however reloading of items is postponed until the next access. this will cause the following test to fail:\n\n        Node n = testRootNode.addNode(\"aFile\", \"nt:file\");\n        n = n.addNode(\"jcr:content\", \"nt:resource\");\n        n.setProperty(\"jcr:lastModified\", Calendar.getInstance());\n        n.setProperty(\"jcr:mimeType\", \"text/plain\");\n        Property jcrData = n.setProperty(\"jcr:data\", \"abc\", PropertyType.BINARY);\n        testRootNode.save();\n\n        // access same property through different session\n        Session otherSession = helper.getReadOnlySession();\n        try {\n            Property otherProperty = (Property) otherSession.getItem(jcrData.getPath());\n            assertTrue(jcrData.isSame(otherProperty));\n        } finally {\n            otherSession.logout();\n        }\n\nwhile \n     \n       assertTrue(n.isSame(otherSession.getItem(n.getPath()));\n\nwould be successful.\n\nthe reason: the jcrData property is not reloaded and it's parent is still _invalidated_. consequently the property isn't aware of it's id having changed due to the fact that nt:resource is a node type extending from mix:referenceable.\n\npossible fixes:\n\n1) mark all items _invalid_ after save \n    instead of setting status non-protected/autocreated properties to EXISTING.\n    -> forcing jcrData to be reloaded before isSame can be called.\n    -> drawback: much more round trip(s) to the server just to make sure the id is up to date.\n\n2) change Item#isSame to make sure the workspaceId is up to date (walking up the\n     hierarchy and force reloading of the first invalidated ancestor).\n     -> drawback: if referenceable nodes are rare or missing at all, this causes some\n          extra round trips.\n \n3) change Item.isSame to compare the 'workspacePath' instead of the 'workspaceId'.\n     -> drawback: upon persisted move of a referenceable node Item#isSame will return false\n\n\nafter taking a closer look at the code and at some additional tests i would opt for 2).\n",
