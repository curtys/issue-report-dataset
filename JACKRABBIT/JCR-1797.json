For example an underlying data store might always return the parent and all grand-parents of a requested item and probably even some of its siblings (i.e. MS Sharepoint). \nWhile traversing a repository from the root node to the leaves, there wont be any gain. However, there is quite some impact on random access. For example when iterating over the result set from a search. ",
