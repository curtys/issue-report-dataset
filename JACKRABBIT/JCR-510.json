However, JSR-170 does not require an implementation to have at least one child node definition with a default primary type.  For such repositories, this test will fail, regardless of configuration.\n\nProposal: introduce a configuration property which, if set, causes calls to addNode(String) to be replaced with addNode(String, String).",
