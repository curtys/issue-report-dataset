The internally used PathMap (spi-commons) creates new Path.Element instances whenever a path is constructed, even when the path is constructed from cached PathMap.Elements.\n\nRunning a test with 10k nodes results in 250k Path.Element instances being created and held in memory (mostly for events).",
