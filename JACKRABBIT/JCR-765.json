I tagged this for the 1.3 release instead of 1.2.3, since the issue is not really a bug that would need an immediate fix.",

    "description": "This is just a \"cosmetic\" fix: when reestablishConnection() is called in DatabasePersistenceManager all the statements are closed but if an error occurs two exceptions are logged for each statement.\nSince reestablishConnection() is already called when an exception has been caught and its only purpose is to cleanup an existing connection and to reopen a new one is pretty common that the connection is already not valid and that each statement close will throw an exception.\n\nFor example if the connection has been broken due to a network problem DatabasePersistenceManager  will log *40* exceptions (2 for each statement) before trying to establish a connection, and that's pretty annoying (expecially if you use a mail appender for log4j....)\n",
