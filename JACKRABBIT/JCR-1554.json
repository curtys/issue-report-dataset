            "body": "\nIt might be that the following explanation is not as it really is, so feel free to correct me:\n\nAn ItemState might have an overlayedState. What I have seen from debugging with lots of logging is that an itemState could have an overlayedState and this overlayedState could also have an overlayedState and so on. \nIf there is a e.g. a property change the ItemStateManger(s) gets \"informed\" and the \"stateModified\" method is called. \nIn transactions the the XAItemStateManager's (which is a sub class of the LocalItemStateManager) \"stateModified\" method is called.\nIf the state already exists the \"pull()\" method is called on that state (ItemState.pull()). The idea of the pull method is to sync up the modification counter with the overlayedState. And here is the issue IMHO because it is only done \"one layer down\" and not top down. \nIf I saw it correctly, with the provided test class, setting a property the first time will end up in one ItemState, setting it the 2nd time you will have an itemState with an overlayedState, calling it the 3rd time, you have itemState->overlayedState->overlayedState. If than \"pull()\" is called to sync up the modCount, it is only done with the itemState->overlayedState and not with the itemState->overlayedState->overlayedState....thats IMHO the reason why you see it at the 3rd time and not before. \n\nTo cut a long story short, here what i changed:\n\nItemState.java (line 152ff): \n\noriginal:\n\n    synchronized void pull() {\n        ItemState state = overlayedState;\n        if (state != null) {\n            // sync modification count\n            copy(state, true);\n        }\n    }\n\nmy modification:\n\n    synchronized void pull() {\n        ItemState state = overlayedState;\n        if (state != null) {\n            // sync modification count top down\n            if (state.isConnected()) {\n                state.pull();\n            }\n            copy(state, true);\n        }\n    }\n\n\nWith that change I was able to a) build jackrabbit and b) run the provided TestNG successfully without the RollbackException (for both tests, setting the item property and deleting a node).\n\nJackrabbit guys, could you please take a look at my proposal.\n\nThanks!!\n\n\n",

            "body": "Hi,\n\nMartin and Philipp, thanks for your input, which helped me a lot understanding what is going wrong here and why. As far as I can tell right now, the issue is caused by the local property state, referenced in the XAItemStateManager's change log, which is not being updated (\"pulled\") correctly at the end of a save operation. Usually, this happens inside SharedItemStateManager.Update.end():\n\n            try {\n                /* Let the shared item listeners know about the change */\n--->         shared.persisted();\n\n                // downgrade to read lock\n\nAmong others, this will notify the XAItemStateManager about the changes made to the property state (modcount increased by 1). Its stateModified() implementation, which is actually contained in the super class LocalItemStateManager, looks like this:\n\n            // shared state was modified\n--->     local = cache.retrieve(modified.getId());\n            if (local != null && local.isConnected()) {\n                // this instance represents existing state, update it\n                local.pull();\n            }\n\nWithout transactions, the local state will be contained in the cache. With transactions, on the other hand, the local state will only be contained in the current transaction's change log, so there will be no update to this state and the modcount stays at its current value.\n\nLooking at the modcounts of the property states in the transient (T), local (L) and shared (S) layers, one can watch the following behaviours in the successive calls to Property.setValue():\n\n1)  T: 0,  L: N/A, S:N/A   (obviously, because the first operation *creates* the property state)\n2)  T: 0,  L: 0, S: 0\n3)  T: 0,  L: 0, S: 1\n\nwhich explains why the 3rd operation wil fail.\n\nI'll further look into this tomorrow, so please stay tuned!\n\nKind regards\nDominique",

    "description": "There seams to be a serious bug in jackrabbit when used in distributed transactions. It does not occur with local transactions! And it seams to be related to JCR-566.\n\nThere are 2 scenarios where a StaleItemStateException occurs reproducible that causes transactions to fail. All my operations (implemented in a custom ServiceBean) such as setProperty() or deleteNode() run in separate transactions. The transactions are configured through Spring Annotations (@Transactional).\n\nScenario A (setProperty):\n(1) multiple setProperty() with same property name on the same node (newly created or already existent)\n=> With the 3. setProperty() (and sometimes also the 5.), a StaleItemStateException for the property state is raised when the transaction is commited. Following setProperty invocations will not fail!\n\nScenario B (deleteNode):\n(1) iterate 10 times:\n(1.1) create new node n and a subnode for n\n(1.2) delete node n\n=> Deletion of node n raises a StaleItemStateException for node n in iteration 1, 3 and (6 or 7), when the related transaction is commited. Following deletions of node n will also fail with a predictable pattern.\n\nThe Exception trace for scenario A (it's the same for scenario B, with one difference: StaleItemStateException is raised for the node and not for the property):\n\norg.springframework.transaction.UnexpectedRollbackException: JTA transaction unexpectedly rolled back (maybe due to a timeout);

Perhaps its a state caching problem...\n\t\nI'm attaching a simple java application configured with maven and ready to run standalone. The JCA container of JBoss is therefore replaced with jencks in order to support distributed transactions. The configured repository uses the InMemPersistenceManager. Both scenarios are implemented in a TestNG - test, that catches the occuring TransactionExceptions and prints out the stacktrace. Therefore you will see the exceptions, but the tests will not fail.",
