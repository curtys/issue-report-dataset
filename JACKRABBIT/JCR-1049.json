(Before MySQL 4.1.2, the limit is 255 bytes for all tables.) Note that prefix limits are measured in bytes, whereas the prefix length in CREATE INDEX statements is interpreted as number of characters for non-binary data types (CHAR, VARCHAR, TEXT). Take this into account when specifying a prefix length for a column that uses a multi-byte character set.\n</quote>\n\nthe current 'create unique index' stmt in mysql.ddl is IMO a good compromise that will work with most  mysql servers out there. \n\n\n\n",
