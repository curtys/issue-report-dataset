Since the permissions are checked based on the state modifications upon save() only, the check for REMOVE permission is omitted.\n\nHowever: The same test being execute with a Workspace.move(String, String) would fail, as the BatchedItemOperations explicitely check for both: REMOVE permission on the target node and ADD_NODE permission on the destination parent.\n\nFor consistency between Session.move() and Workspace.move() i would opt for adding the corresponding permission check to Session.move().
