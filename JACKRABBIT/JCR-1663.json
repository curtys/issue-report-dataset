            "body": "We have a big repository with several tenths of thousands of nodes (which have versions). Each node has 4 reference properties.\nI'm now looking at our application heap snapshot. Its overall size is 400+ mb and almost 200 mb are strings (nearly 1.4 million of them). Most of those strings are in NameImpl instances (more than 1.3 million of instances). And nearly 1.3 million of strings are actually duplicates of 8 different strings which are local names and full names of our 4 reference properties.\nSo I think it's a real issue that needs to be resolved :) Our use case is an example when Jackrabbit uses memory inefficiently.\n\nJukka's suggestion looks much better than mine: consider 1.3 million of NameImpl instances in the example.",

Will it be possible for you to upload the source file for \"NameFactoryImpl.java\"? We are running the latest build but we are now getting a compile errors (localName & namespaceURI \"var. not found\") after the latest changes were incorporated into this module. Thanks.\n\n/Antonio C.\n",

See http://developers.sun.com/learning/javaoneonline/2007/pdf/TS-2707.pdf  page 38ff. I don't want to spoil it in case you like to solve the puzzle yourself... By the way, I can highly recommend the book \"Java Puzzlers\".\n\nSomething completely different: did you know that % (mod) is slower than & (bitwise and)? Also the following wouldn't require Math.abs. You _need_ to use a power of 2 size then, but you could document that as follows:\n\nprivate final static int SIZE_POWER_OF_2 = 1 << 10;\nprivate final Name[] names = new Name[SIZE_POWER_OF_2];\n...\nint position = name.hashCode() & (SIZE_POWER_OF_2 - 1);\n\nRegards,\nThomas",

    "description": "When reference property is loaded from PM, Serializer.deserialize(NodeReferences, InputStream) is called, which calls PropertyId.valueOf(String), which in turn calls NameFactoryImpl.create(String) which finally splits a full property name to namespace and local name. Namespace is internalized, but local name is not (comments say that this is done to avoid perm space overfilling).\nSo, in the end, a new String instance is created for local name. This leads to considerable memory waste when repository has a lot of nodes with REFERENCE properties.\nIt seems that local name part could be internalized here too because in the most repositories it's not allowed to create properties with arbitrary names, so the danger of perm space exhaust does not seem to be an argument.\n\nAs for ways to resolve this, maybe a new NameFactory implementation could be created which would be used for properties only (and, possibly, mainly in the PropertyId.valueOf(String)) which would extend an existing NameFactoryImpl overriding its create(String) method.\n\nWhat do you think about all this?",
