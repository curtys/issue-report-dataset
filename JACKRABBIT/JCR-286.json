    "description": "At present, DAV Explorer won't log in to the JCR WebDav servlet - it doesn't even ask for a username & password.  (Neither the Microsoft WinXP WebDAV & Novell's NetDrive were as fussy and were happy to log in)\nUsing Ethereal, I compared the traffic for a valid Slide WebDav login compared to a JCR WebDav login.\n\nI've now found and fixed the problem on my local build, and I've now got DAV Explorer to work with JCR Webdav.  Here's a description of the bugfix:\n\nIn jackrabbit/contrib/jcr-server/server/src/java/org/apache/jackrabbit/server/AbstractWebdavServlet.java, there is a public static final String DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATE_HEADER.\nThis is currently set to \"Basic Realm=Jackrabbit Webdav Server\".\n\nThis is not a valid string for use in this context as it is in breach of RFC2617 for 2 reasons:\n1) \"Realm\" should be \"realm\"\n2) \"Jackrabbit Webdav Server\" should be in quotes, i.e. \"\\\"Jackrabbit Webdav Server\\\"\"\n\nAccording to http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt, a valid challenge would be:\n   WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm=\"WallyWorld\"\nNote that \"realm\" is not capitalised and \"WallyWorld\" has been enclosed in quotes (the \"WWW-Authenticate: \" string is held elsewhere in the Java code and is correct)\n\n\nIn other words, AbstractWebdavServlet.java line 82, which currently reads:\n    public static final String DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATE_HEADER = \"Basic Realm=Jackrabbit Webdav Server\";\nshould be changed to read\n    public static final String DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATE_HEADER = \"Basic realm=\\\"Jackrabbit Webdav Server\\\"\";\n\n",
