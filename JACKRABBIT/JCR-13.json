    "description": "In previous versions (e.g. SVN tag 0.1-spec0.14) it was possible to disable the SearchManagers by not configuring a search index path. In the current revision, a NullPointerException is thrown, if the search index configuration is missing, tough the rest of the system would support missing search index configuration as before.\n\nI suggest to extend search index configuration interpretation in WorkspaceCfg.init as follows:\n\n        Element srchConfig = wspElem.getChild(SEARCH_INDEX_ELEMENT);\n        if (srchConfig != null) {\n            String pathAttr = srchConfig.getAttributeValue(PATH_ATTRIB);\n            if (pathAttr != null && pathAttr.length() > 0) {\n                searchIndexDir = replaceVars(pathAttr, vars);\n            }\n        }\n\nThis only reads search index configuration if available.\n\nThe reason to switch of the SearchManager is, that in my use case enabling the SearchManager yields a performance degradation of a factor of 10 ! Instead of taking around 500ms (which is still too long :-) to save 3 nodes and 15 properties, it would take around 5 seconds to save the same amount of data. And I do not need the SearchManager in my use case.",
