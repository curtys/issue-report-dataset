The version history that can be access from the request  resource, cannot be used to retrieve the versions needed for a workspace.restore call.\n\npossible short term fix:\nFrom the version-hrefs present in the request body of the UPDATE request, version resources must be built and\nthe corresponding version item retrieved.\n\nalternative:\nfind a proper mapping for Workspace.restore(Version[], boolean). having UPDATE on a resource representing a javax.jcr.Node being mapped to a workspace.restore is odd.\n\n",
