            "body": "I'm not too much of a fan of duplicating so much of the code in OperandEvaluator.\n\nIt would be nice if instead the Node to be used was simply wrapped into a simple row instance with a default full text search score and then passed to the existing code. The attached patch does this by moving the generic Row implementations to -core to -jcr-commons and then using the SelectorRow class in the OperandEvaluator to support also Nodes in addition to Rows.\n\nPS. What's the use of the getAffectedPropertyName() method? Note that the property under a given Operand also depends on the selector name, so just getting the property name doesn't tell you much unless you already have more context information for interpreting it (in which case you might already have also the property name).",

            "body": "I've seen the option with wrapping a Node in a Row just to use the OperandEvaluator, but then it kinda feels hacky. Everything is there already.\n\nThe property name thing will make sense when you take a look at JCR-2959. I couldn't find another way of extracting the property that is used by an Operand. But you may be right, this could fail in certain scenarios.\n\nI needed to build a lucene sort mechanism, and all the info you have is the Ordering, which holds an Operand, and a bunch of nodes. As the sort should happen before the Row is actually constructed.\nOk, there may be better ways of extracting this info, I'll digg into it",

For example \"ORDER BY UPPER(pname)\" or \"ORDER BY LENGTH(pname)\" must be handled differently from \"ORDER BY pname\", and an ordering like \"ORDER BY b.pname\" can't be used if you're constructing the Lucene query for selector a. Thus I don't think an isolated method like getAffectedPropertyName() really serves a useful purpose.",

That's probably not a very likely scenario, but ideally the implementation should be able to handle also cases like that.\n\nMore generally, you'll lose any performance benefits as soon as the custom Lucene sort field tries to access the full node instance.
