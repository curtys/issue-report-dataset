    "description": "just found a path-related spi2dav test failing that passed some time before jackrabbit 2.0 (BatchTest#testSetPathValue).\n\ni had a quick look at it and it seems to me that the reasons is the internal (Path, Name) value representation \nbeing exposed when calling Value#getBinary(), Value#getStream() and the corresponding shortcuts on Property.\n\nfrom my understanding of the specification these methods should always return the standard JCR path (or name) representation as it\nis exposed by Value#getString() and Property#getString() as it used to be in previous versions.\n\n\n\n",
