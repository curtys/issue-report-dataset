My co-worker's did it within a quater of an hour and may (automatically) include our standart header without further considerations.\n\n\nUnfortunately, even using v1.4-rc1, our main (blocking) issue haven't gone: After a breakdown of the underying database connection (due to an idle timeout or a failure) the repository is unusable because it still fails to re-establish the database connection layer.\n\nI'll rescan the project jira for this an may open an issue ...\n\nsincerely yours \n\nGuido\n \n",

And here -- but only here -- the re-connect works now.  \n\nWe're dealing with the PersistantManager and FileSystem connections (for repository and the workspace(s)), and they are still lost.\n\n",

From the shortness and simplicity of the source code of the other ones, i think adding this missing feature takes just about an hour.\n\nThank you for support",
