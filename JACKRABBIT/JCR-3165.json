With the introduction of JCR-2906 which introduces arrays into the mix, I'd like to refactor all of them into one place, namely o.a.j.core.query.lucene.Util.\n\nThis will also allow for a wider scope of comparison for Value[], marked as TODO in the ValueComparator class.\n\nWill attach patch shortly",
