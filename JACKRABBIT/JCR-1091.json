As in:\n\npublic boolean needsMixin(Node n, String mixin) {\n  return ! n.getSession().getWorkspace().getNodeTypeManager().getNodeType(n.getNodeType()).isNodeType(mixin);\n}",

However, since the TCK uses the same canAddMixin() method to find new mixins (i.e. ones that are not already included in a node) to add to a node, the tests would always fail.\n\nThe committed resolution adds the \"succeed if the mixin is already set\" test directly in the addMixin() method.",
