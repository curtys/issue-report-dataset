    "description": "According to tobi the jackrabbit implementation of 'Node.restoreByLabel' is an interpretation of the\nspecification regarding the restore behaviour of versionable child nodes. while that interpetration might\nbe legal unless the specification is violated, i would argue that the TCK should not test the interpretation.\n\ntherefore i suggest to modify\n\norg.apache.jackrabbit.test.api.version.RestoreTest.testRestoreLabel\n\nby skipping line 334 - 345 in order to limit the test case to the behaviour that is defined by the specification.\n\nregards\nangela\n\nps: the mentioned test is also executed within the scope of WorkspaceRestoreTest because the latter  extends RestoreTest.... that's misleading.",
