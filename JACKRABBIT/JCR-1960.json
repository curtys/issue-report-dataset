First you need Maven 2 and svn, You would need to download the source code:\n\nsvn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/trunk\n\nThen you should make sure the default configuration works on your machine:\n\nmvn clean install\n\nThen change the configuration files jackrabbit-core/src/test/repository/repository.xml and jackrabbit-core/src/test/repository/workspaces/*/workspace.xml (the most important workspaces are default and test), then re-run the test suite again (mvn clean install).\n\nRegards,\nThomas\n",

Help is always appreciated though...\n\n    I'm uploading a new svn diff which is against the tags/1.5.2 source; it has some small corrections in it around the sql. The work that needs to be done now is in java. As I get time, I will continue to work on getting apache-jackrabbit going with Ingres. Ingres 9.2 enterprise edition for linux 32bit was released just the other day and can be downloaded from the Ingres website for free. It is this version of Ingres that I am working with.\n\nTake care,\n    Murray",

It is against the 1.5.2 version from the tags repository.\n\n    I was looking around but couldn't see if there was a way of running a test suite using Ingres as the DBMS provider. Is that possible with the current environment?\n\nCheers",
