Maybe it can be #IMPLIED, i.e.\n<!ATTLIST AccessControlProvider class CDATA #IMPLIED>\nFor 2 reasons I personaly think the #REQUIRED correction you mentioned IS correct :\n* The documentation for this attribute says it's a class name, it should be required, so #REQUIRED\n* It corrects the document in the more restrictive way.\n \n \n Sincerely,\n  S.\n \n_________________________________________________________________\nFaites vous de nouveaux amis gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l'annuaire des profils Messenger !\nhttp://home.services.spaces.live.com/search/?page=searchresults&ss=true&FormId=AdvPeopleSearch&form=SPXFRM&tp=3&sc=2&pg=0&Search.DisplayName=Nom+public&search.gender=&search.age=&Search.FirstName=Pr%C3%A9nom&Search.LastName=Nom&search.location=Lieu&search.occupation=Profession&search.interests=amis&submit=Rechercher\n",

The fact that it took us 3 months to fix the broken DTD on the web site seems to imply that we either should drop it in the future, or to make sure that it actually works (regression test for web site?).\n\n",
