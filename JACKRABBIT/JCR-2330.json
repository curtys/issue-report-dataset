    "description": "In revision 504623 we commented out the mix:referenceable check in the SessionImpl.getNodeByUUID() method:\n\n    // since the uuid of a node is only exposed through jcr:uuid declared\n    // by mix:referenceable it's rather unlikely that a client can possibly\n    // know the internal uuid of a non-referenceable node; omitting the\n    // check for mix:referenceable seems therefore to be a reasonable\n    // compromise in order to improve performance.\n    /*\n    if (node.isNodeType(Name.MIX_REFERENCEABLE)) {\n        return node;\n    } else {\n        // there is a node with that uuid but the node does not expose it\n        throw new ItemNotFoundException(uuid.toString());\n    }\n    */\n\nThis solved a minor performance issue issue with client code that used the node UUID as a quick way to access a node. The downside was a slight incompatibility with the spec that says that the getNodeByUUID method is only supposed to work with mix:referenceable nodes.\n\nNow with JCR 2.0 clients can (and should) use the Session.getNodeByIdentifier method that does not have the mix:referenceable limitation. Thus we can restore the original and correct functionality of the getNodeByUUID method.",
