    "description": "The UUID value of a referenceable nodes is currently add to the index four times:\n- As a system field _:UUID\n- As a property value for jcr:uuid\n- As part of the node scope fulltext index\n- As part of the jcr:uuid property scope fulltext index\n\nIn a repository with lots of referenceable nodes this bloates the index and does not add much value. Searching a node by its UUID is preferably done using the equal operator and not by using the jcr:contains() function.\n\nI suggest to remove fulltext indexing of the jcr:uuid property. Existing indexes would still work after this change, new or updated nodes would simply not have the property jcr:uuid fulltext indexed anymore.",
