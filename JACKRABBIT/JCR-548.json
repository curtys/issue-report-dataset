Hope I do this the right way :-) \n\nSome weeks ago I postet a message on the forum about a node type documentation tool I had made. Now, finally I have cleaned up the code and fixed some bugs. It is now useful for the majority out there. I do not guarantee it to be bug-free, but will do my best to fix any bugs that is reported. \n\nA readme file is included in the distribution. Must build using maven 2. Have not done it maven 1 compliant.",
