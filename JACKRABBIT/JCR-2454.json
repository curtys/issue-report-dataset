In order to use CompactNodeTypeDefWriter jackrabbit-jcr-server needs to depend on jackrabbit-spi and jackrabbit-spi-commons (not sure if that's a problem).\nAlso the client now sends the allowUpdate-Flag (is not a problem for the JAVA client as this is already checked on the client side, but other clients have to set it now).\n\nIf there any further comments, let me know.\n\nKind regards\nUwe",
