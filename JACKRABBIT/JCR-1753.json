It adds the method forceClusterSync() to the JackrabbitRepository interface and implements the method in the three implementations of the interface.\n\nThe patches stray from Jukka's suggestion of naming the method sync() as the use case I was needing solved involved a clustered environment.  sync() seems general enough that it might indicate the repository implementation would pick up any changes made to the data store.  I know on the mailing list altering the database directly instead of through JCR/Jackrabbit API is discouraged so perhaps that isn't a valid use case.\n\nI'm also not completely familiar with all use cases and therefore the implementations of the method only work in a clustered environment.  I assume that multiple repositories hitting the same database in an unclustered environment could be considered invalid.  However if this assumption is incorrect then the code will need to be changed to handle that.\n\n[1] - http://www.nabble.com/Forcing-a-cluster-synch-td19578255.html",

IIUC the cluster works like an eventually consistent system (see [1] for an introduction). If the application can guarantee 'session consistency' (i.e. an application session always uses a given cluster node and only switches to another cluster node when it goes down) the consequences of the inconsistency window should be very limited.\n\nMicah, can you please elaborate why you need a cluster node to be in sync? Even if you can sync a cluster node, it might get out of sync again right away by a modification of another cluster node.\n\n[1] http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2007/12/eventually_consistent.html",

            "body": "My use case is described in the mailing list link included in the first comment.  I read the article you linked to and it was very interesting.  In my situation we are shooting for session consistency however there is not means to guarantee the stickiness of the session on the server side.  The setup I have is operations are routed between 3 different JVMs and each JVM is read/writing to the JCR repository.  So the use case I'm shooting for is client 1 performs writes which get routed to JVM1.  The same client then performs a read on that write however the operation is routed to JVM2.  In this situation I know that the write operation has occurred but when retrieving from the repository get a PathNotFoundException.  So in that case I'd like to sync to update JVM2.  After I sync I attempt to read and either get the value I'm looking for or I don't.  If i don't then I know that a concurrent modification has occurred and report the appropriate response back to the client.  ",

I'd therefore change the semantics of the method described above to:\n\n(1) either return immediately if a thread is already inside doSync() is already in progress\n(2) or wait for the processing thread in doSync() to finish and then return\n\nOptionally, the wait in (2) might again be limited by a timeout in order to avoid locking the complete system.\n\nWDYT?",

Additionally, if the node already is in sync with the cluster (which would be the usual case), then the sync amounts to just retrieving the journal revision number and comparing it with the local state.\n\nIf the retrieval of the journal revision number is expensive, we could add an additional local guard that just ensures that at least one cluster sync has been done between a client calling Session.refresh() (or Repository.login()) and the call returning. Whether it's that thread or some other thread doing the sync doesn't matter. Something like this:\n\n    private volatile int syncCount = 0;\n\n    int count = syncCount;\n    mutex.acquire();\n    try {\n        if (count == syncCount) {\n            doSync();\n            syncCount++;\n        }\n    } finally {\n        mutex.release();\n    }\n",

I don't think that's too much, but you're right in that there are cases (one example is a web site without a session pool) where avoiding any extra perfromance hit on login() would be beneficial.\n\nI think it would be OK if we didn't trigger the cluster sync on login(). A client could still use refresh() to ensure causal consistency (Micah's use case).\n\n> What about specifying a lower bound on the delay (e.g. 1 second) that should pass before\n> another journal sync actually takes place?\n\nThat would kind of defeat the purpose as the client would then have no way (apart from explicitly waiting for that one second and retrying the sync) to ensure consistent access to the repository.",

If there was a change, the cluster mechanism will call PersistenceManager.onExternalUpdate(), which is potentially expensive. Without a lower bound on the delay, the system may get unusably slow. For example, if there is a background thread that calls Session.refresh() once a second, and if PersistenceManager.onExternalUpdate() takes one second. ",

            "body": "> For example, if there is a background thread that calls Session.refresh() once a second,\n> and if PersistenceManager.onExternalUpdate() takes one second.\n\nWhy is that a problem? With the syncCount patch any later refresh() methods will just wait for the first invocation to finish before just returning without invoking another sync. Also, the usual case is that there are no changes to report, so the amortized cost of the refresh() method is still pretty small.\n\nThe sync mutex already implements a lower bound delay that prevents any two syncs from executing concurrently. Adding more delay is IMHO stepping to the client territory. The client may have a good reason to want to sync more frequently (Micah's round robin case is an excellent example) and I see no reason why the repository should explicitly try to degrade the performance below what the hardware is capable of.",
