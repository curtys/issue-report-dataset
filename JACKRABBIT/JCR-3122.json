    "description": "QueryObjectModelImpl doesn't leverage the SessionOperation closure approach (like the QueryImpl does). \n\nSwitching to this style of running a query yields some gains in speed (I ran 50 queries per test):\n - #1. old style   (no code change)       avg was 14.26 ms\n - #2. new style (as session operation) avg was 12.14 ms\n - #3. new style (as session operation) avg was   6.44 ms\n - #4. new style (as session operation) avg was   6.68 ms\n - #5. old style  (no code change)        avg was 11.62 ms\n - #6. old style  (no code change)        avg was 11.66 ms",
