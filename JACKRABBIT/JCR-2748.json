Isn't that a bit onerous - 15-20 lines of XML vs. one?\n\nIn other words, I think this should be configured in the <Security> section of repository.xml, not <Workspace> as it is a property of the security subsystem.",

    "description": "As discussed in this thread: http://sling.markmail.org/thread/st52jejjuxykfxtj, the security workspace is, by default, configured with an AccessControlProvider which provides a fixed access control policy (i.e. o.a.j.core.security.user.UserAccessControlProvider). In order to prevent anonymous access to security-related nodes requires the use of an alternate AccessControlProvider.\n\nThe attached patch provides a simpler mechanism. By adding\n\n<param name=\"anonymousAccessToSecurityWorkspace\" value=\"false\" />\n\nto the configuration of the DefaultSecurityManager, anonymous access to the security workspace is forbidden.\n",
