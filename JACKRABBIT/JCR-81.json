This user id is configurable in jaas.config with the anonymousId module option. A Session aquired with such credentials has read-only access to the repository.\n\nIf null credentials are passed to one of the Repository.login() methods the SimpleLoginModule tries to retreive the Subject from the AccessControlContext. If none is found a LoginException is thrown.\n\nI have changed the first steps examples to use a different userid than anonymous, because they will now return a read-only session.\n\nSVN revision: 159358",

    "description": "Jackrabbit currently implements anonymous login by detecting a null credentials argument on login. This is actually not compliant to the specification.\n\n<spec>\nIf credentials is null, it is assumed that authentication is handled by a mechanism external to the repository itself (for example, through the JAAS framework) and that the repository implementation exists within a context (for example, an application server) that allows it to handle authorization of the request for access to the specified workspace.\n</spec>\n\nJackrabbit should rather support anonymous login with a defined credential, either some subclass of SimpleCredentials or a predefined / known userId that has read-only access.",
