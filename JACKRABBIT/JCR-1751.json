So 1.5.3 it\nis! :)\n\nIf you have a look at the jcl104-over-slf4j\nPOM<http://svn.slf4j.org/viewvc/slf4j/trunk/jcl104-over-slf4j/pom.xml?view=markup>,\nyou'll see that it's deprecated and relocated to jcl-over-slf4j. So it would\nbe cleaner to update the dependency and not only the version.\n\nSincerely,\n\nStephane\n\n\n2008/9/22 Micah Whitacre (JIRA) <jira@apache.org>\n\n",
