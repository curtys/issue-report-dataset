The code is not really clean right now.\n\nThe versionning is well done (i think), but I have a problem to access to the content of a version, it's not working. I try with Dav Explorer to download a version, but the file contain html :\n\n<html><head><title>Jackrabbit 1.0-dev /jcr:system/jcr:versionStorage/95/eb/1c/95\neb1c99-2545-4ce4-bdd6-219e5e488929/1.2</title></head><body><h2>/jcr:system/jcr:v\nersionStorage/95/eb/1c/95eb1c99-2545-4ce4-bdd6-219e5e488929/1.2</h2><ul><li><a h\nref=\"..\">..</a></li></ul><hr size=\"1\"><em>Powered by <a href=\"http://www.apache.\norg/\">Jackrabbit</a> version 1.0-dev</em></body></html>\n\n\nAnd with cadaver, i try to look the version report, and all the size are at 0. So maybe I do something wrong.\n\nI try to use the child node jcr:frozen instead of the version node, but it's the same problem.\n\nCan someone take a look at the code?\n\nThanks,\nJ\u00e9r\u00e9mi",

            "body": "so... had a look at the changes and i found the following things. i already started modifying the patch a bit, so there is no need for a new one. just for the record:\n\n- DeltaVResourceImpl: compliance class should from my point of view also mention the Label feature\n- VersionableResourceImpl: the supported method set lists MERGE, UPDATE although the implementation is\n  missing\n- VersionableResourceImpl: the DAV:predecessor-set property is missing \n- if upon retrieving version-history and version the returned resource does not implement the proper interface\n  i would rather throw than returning null.\n- DavResourceFactoryImpl: since the simple server should work on top of any JCR repository i added a check\n  if versioning is supported by the repository and act accordingly.\n\nall new resources extending from DavResourceImpl:\n- the DavResourceImpl checks if the properties have been initialized before. this check is missing.\n\nSince the time jeremi originally copied code from the jcr-server the simple server has been modified (see JCR-416): no exporting custom properties is delegated to the PropertyHandler. However, from my point of view\nit doesn't make sense to additionally export all the specific properties defined by nt:version and nt:versionhistory\nand mix:versionable. most of them are already covered by predefined DAV properties. Therefore:\n\n- VersionHandler should implements its own exportProperties method.\n- perhaps it makes sense to define a VersionHistoryHandler. otherwise they would be exported/imported by\n  the DefaultHandler which probably doesn't make to much sense.\n- the DefaultHandler should skip the version specific properties.\n\nin addition:\n- the VersionHandler assumes that the nt:frozenNode contains a jcr:content node. That might be the case\n  if nt:file nodes are put under version control. But since there might be other versionable nodes in the repository\n  the handler should at least check if the jcr:content node exists.\n\nso far my changes. i would like to test them (and maybe find others), then provide another patch, so you can \nalso verify that the changes still fit your needs before they get commited.\n\none thing i didn't have time to look at (maybe rob or ed?):\nthe DavResourceImpl uses the configuration to determine which items should be filtered out and should\nnot appear in the webdav-view to the repository. by default the 'jcr' prefix is filtered. i wondered whether this could cause inconsistencies with the planned changes.\n\nfinally, there is yet another thing that has not been taken into consideration by none of the patches so\nfar (and for which i don't have a quick solution at hand):\n\nRFC 3253 defines a separate behaviour for version-controlled collections. However the current approach \ndoes not take into account whether a resource represents a collection or not. As soon as the corresponding\nrepository node is of type mix:versionable the resource is exposed to be versionable as well. If we want\nto make the simple server to be compliant to RFC 3253 this should be addressed. \n\ni wouldn't mind if this would be done in a second step, but we should take a look at it.\n\nregards\nangela",
