    "description": "Inside an XATransaction immediately removing a version that was created by a checkin succeeds, even though it should fail because referential integrity is violated. The reason seems to be that the created version does not return any references.\n\nIn the end the transaction fails because referential integrity is checked again in the SharedItemStateManager, which is correct. But IMO removeVersion() should fail first.\n\nAdded test case: org.apache.jackrabbit.core.version.CheckinRemoveVersionTest",
