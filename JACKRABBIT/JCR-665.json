            "body": "Ah, correct! Thanks for the fix.\n\nIn fact I should probaly look at refactoring the entire BinaryValue implementation in JCR-RMI, as the current implementation gets the stream consumed when the instance is serialized. For now it's no problem since the Value instance is only used for a single serialization, but this might turn out to cause trouble later on.\n\nPS. When resolving issues, please only \"Resolve\" it and do not \"Close\" it. This makes it possible to edit the issue metadata when preparing a release (for example I'd set the fields for versions affected and fixed). The issue should only be \"Closed\" when it goes out in an official release to signify that there will be no more changes to that issue. See my recent Jira guidelines message to dev@.\n",
