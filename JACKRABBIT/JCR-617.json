    "description": "There is a problem with weak referenced item states and event notification in the\nLocalItemStateManager.\n\nconsider the following:\n- Session A traverses some nodes and fills-up the cache of the ChachingHierarchyManager\n- This also fills the weak-ref cache in Session A LocalItemStateManager.\n- Session B does some operations\n- At some point, GC decides to remove the weakly refferenced ItemStates in Session As\n  LocalItemStateManager\n- Session B moves a node and saves the changes.\n- The SharedItemStateManager notifies all listeners that a node was modified\n- The LocalItemStateManager of Session A receives the event, but does not bubble it,\n  because it does not have the item anymore in its cache\n- The CachingHierarchyManager of Session A never receives the modification event and still\n  servers the items at the old location.\n\nSolution A:\nreconnect missing states in the LocalItemStateManager when an event is received. this has\nthe drawback that a lot of state would be generated that are not needed.\n\nSolution B:\nadd a new event 'nodeModified' that is only sent by the LocalItemStateManager if a\n'stateModified' was received for which it does not have the item aymore. this has the\ndrawback that alot more events are generated.\n\nWill implement solution B\n",
