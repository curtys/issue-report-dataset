    "description": "These tests make a lot of assumptions that may not be true for a compliant repository, such as:\n\n- ability to add nodes without specifiying the node type\n- assumption that ordering and same name siblings are supported\n- assumption that addMixin(lockable) is required on newly added nodes\n\nFurthermore, some repositories may not support shallow locks on leaf nodes. That's not compliant, but failure to do so should not abort a test that tests something else.\n",
