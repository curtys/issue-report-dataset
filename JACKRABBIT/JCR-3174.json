    "description": "WebdavRequestImpl.getHrefLocator tests if the URI passed as parameter starts with the context path, and passes the next segments to the locator factory.\n \nThere is a potential hole if the parameter contains \"..\", because \"http://example.com/dav/../foo\" starts with the context path \"http://example.com/dav\" but represents to \"http://example.com/foo\". Currently, it is up to the locator factory to detect this situation, meaning that every locator factory should implement this check. Additionally, DavLocatorFactory.createResourceLocator cannot throw exceptions, hence it would not fail cleanly (RuntimeException causing a 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR response, when a 403 FORBIDDEN status code would have been apropriate)\n\nNote that the Request-URI should have already been normalized by the servlet container, but in COPY/MOVE operations, the Destination-URI is not normalized.\n\nConformant clients MUST NOT use dot-segments (\".\" or \"..\")  [RFC 4918, Section 8.3] in Simple-Ref constructions such as the Destination header [RFC 4918, Section 10.3]), but the server should be able to detect this error.\n\nProposed change in WebdavRequestImpl:193 (in package org.apache.jackrabbit.webdav from webdav/java)\n- ref = uri.getRawPath();\n+ ref = uri.normalize().getRawPath();\n\n(This causes /dav/../foo to be rejected because it doesn't start with the context path, and accepts dav/foo/../bar because it starts with the context path)",
