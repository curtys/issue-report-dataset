I suggest to use the same mechanism for all modules that require a connection.\n\nIn this patch, no new property is required, instead the existing driver and url properties are used: To use JNDI, the driver class name must reference a javax.naming.Context class (for example javax.naming.InitialContext), and the URL must be the JNDI URL (for example java:comp/env/jdbc/Test).\n\nIf nobody objects, I will check in this patch in a few days.",

AFAIK there's no requirement that a JDBC driver class has a public default constructor.",
