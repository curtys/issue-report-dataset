            "body": "Yes, a quite small repository (a few large items), and the streaming of data is also slow.\n\nIt seems that FileDataStore relies on the tmp file being updated at least once (at least one block is written?) b/w the GC calls to updateModifiedDateOnAccess(..) and deleteAllOlderThan(..). If not, then the lastModified() value on the tmpFile is \"old\", and it is deleted.\n\nThe attached patch fixes my immediate problems, but tmp files may then leak under some circumstances. There is the option of simply using deleteOnExit() on these files.\n\nAlternatively, tmp files could be tracked by the 'inUse' map, or something similar.\n",

The data is written to the file and then it is moved to its final location (based on the contents hash).\n\nIf the garbage collector runs whilst this temp file is present, it deletes it (on Solaris 10 at least), and the addRecord fails at the attempt to rename the now non-existent temp file.\n\nI am attaching a minimal patch that prevents these temp files being deleted by deleteOlderRecursive(..), regardless of their lastModified() value.\n\nI have made this a Minor priority, since there is the obvious workaround of disabling the GC.\n",
