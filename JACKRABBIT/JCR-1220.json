As a new user that needs a few pointers to getting Jackrabbit running.\n\nI have deployed the war using the tomcat manager file after installing Tomcat, but have no idea where to put the jar files, where the class path is etc.\n\nwould anyone help please?\n\nerror \"The javax.jcr.Repository interface from the JCR API could not be loaded. To resolve this issue, you need to make the jcr-1.0.jar available in the shared classpath of the servlet container.\"\n\nWhat would really help is a little bit more information in the \"First Hops\" section for people who are not already familiar with Java.\n",
