    "description": "for example, you cannot use underscores in node type definitions:\n[my:example_breaks2]\n\nIn fact only A-Z, a-z, 0-9, : are allowed, unless you quote the name. The error message you see when you make this mistake doesn't give any hint:\nMissing ']' delimiter for end of node type name (nodetypes.cnd, line 8)\n\nand the documentation on the website and the javadoc for CompactNodeTypeDefReader both just say:\n\n * unquoted_string ::= ...a string...\n\n... not helpful. If you made this mistake, you end up needing to look at the source to figure out what you've done wrong. \n\nA few suggested solutions:\n- change the documentation to say unquoted string is '[A-Za-z0-9:]+'\n- change the error message to mention the token causing the problem, eg:\nif (!currentTokenEquals(Lexer.END_NODE_TYPE_NAME)) {\n            lexer.fail(\"Missing '\" + Lexer.END_NODE_TYPE_NAME + \"' delimiter for end of node type name, found \" + currentToken);\n}\n- add \"st.wordChars('_','_');\" to the lexer, its probably going to be the most common cause, and doesnt conflict with other rules.\n",
