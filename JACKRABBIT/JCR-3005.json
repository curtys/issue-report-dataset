            "body": "Attached is a patch, which basically implements this. It's a Proof of Concept and far from perfect. But I wanted to get some feedback before I invest more time\n\nIt is modelled the same way as COPY, CLONE and DIFF in JcrRemotingServlet.java\n\nThe basic idea is taken from http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/HTTP_Bulk_Document_API but I choose not to use JSON for submitting the data for consistency and code reuseability\n\nYou can call it with\n\n curl -X POST -d ':get=/node1&:get=/node2' http://localhost:8080/server/workspace/jcr:root/node2.0.json\n\nand it returns an array of all the found nodes as a JSON array\n\nQuestions:\n\n* Should we return the amount of found nodes as well. Something like {\"total_nodes\": 3, \"nodes\": [node1,node2,node3]}?\n* Now, if the node in the URL matches on of the nodes in the body, it is only returned once, if the same node is mentioned more than once in the body it is returned more than once. What should be the approach here? Should we avoid duplicate nodes or just live with it?\n* What should happen, if there's a node not found. I prefer the \"just ignore it\" way\n* What should happen, if there's any other error? Report that or just return what can be returend?\n* I added the path of the node as \"jcr:path\" to the data. Is this the right approach or does anyone have a better idea?",

I committed the patch as-is in revision 1179531 and changed it slightly in revision 1179532 to allow exceptions from the getMultiple method instead of just logging them (BTW, we use SLF4J for logging).\n\nSome comments on the implementation:\n\n* Wouldn't it make more sense for this to be a GET request rather than a POST? Something like: curl 'http://localhost:8080/server/workspace/jcr:root/node2.0.json?:get=/node1&:get=/node2'\n\n* Instead of implementing parts of the JSON serialization in the getSimple() method, it would be cleaner to add a method like JsonWriter.write(Node[] nodes, int depth)\n\n* The return statement inside the conditional in doPost() increases the complexity of the already tricky flow of that method. Can we refactor the code slightly to make the flow more obvious?\n",

Anyway, I see your point and will make sure that this is either resolved in time for 2.3.1 or that the feature is disabled in the release until we have consensus about the exact implementation.\n\nIn revision 1179564 I changed this feature to respond only to GET requests on a workspace resource. If such a request contains one or more :path parameters, then the JSON response containing information about all the identified nodes/subtrees is returned. For example:\n\n    $ curl http://localhost:8080/server/default?:path=/node1&:path=/node2\n    {\"nodes\":{\"/node1\":{...},\"/node2\":{...}}}\n\nAn optional :depth parameter can be used to override the configured default subtree depth to include. Note that the current code doesn't support the configuration of default depth per node type, only the overall default depth is used.\n\nNotes:\n\n* I prefer GET over REPORT for this since GET requests are generally easier to handle by many clients and they are better understood by various intermediaries like web proxies or firewalls\n\n* I see the point of using POST instead of GET for a large request, but I'd rather handle that using a generic POST-to-GET conversion so we can support both GET and POST requests for this information.",

            "body": "> simply retrieving the workspace name from the locator wasn't my intention.\n\nI'm just using the locator to check whether the request is targeting a workspace resource or not. Is there a better way to do that? The other alternative I considered was using instanceof WorkspaceResource, but that didn't seem any cleaner. Ideally I think we should allow the resource itself to process the HTTP request, but that would require quite a bit of refactoring of the current codebase.\n\n> request ANY dav resource and get back the json-serialization of some other resources.\n\nIn the HTTP sense the resource is the one identified by the full URI (e.g. .../default?:path=/node1&path=/node2) instead of just the path part (.../default), so I don't see a fundamental disconnect here. From the perspective of a clean URI space though it would of course be nicer if the multi-read case was better rooted to a single root resource.\n\nOne way we could achieve that would be to introduce extra \":include\" and \":exclude\" patterns for the normal batch-read functionality. Such patterns direct which parts of the subtree rooted at the identified resources should be included in or excluded from the JSON response. For example:\n\n    $ curl http://localhost:8080/server/default/jcr:root/path.json?:include=node1&:include=node2\n    {...,\"node1\":{...},\"node2\":{...}}\n\nor\n\n    $ curl http://localhost:8080/server/default/jcr:root/.json?:include=path&:exclude=path/node2\n    {...,\"path\":{\"node1\":{...},\"node3\":{...}}}",

The JSON output format is still the same as proposed above and the depth of included subtrees is set based on the addressed resource instead of the included nodes themselves. No :exclude support is included. A better alternative could be to treat the :include rules more like extensions to the specified depth and have the results be embedded inside the normal JSON tree, but that still requires extra work.\n\nUnscheduling from 2.3.1 to give us more time to come up with a solution that works for everyone.
