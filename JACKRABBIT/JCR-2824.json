    "description": "Throughout the JCR and Jackrabbit API methods that include name processing are define to throw RepositoryException in case of \nan error related to name processing (due to lack of a more specific exception in the javax.jcr package space).\n\nUnfortunately, I forgot those in JackrabbitAccessControlList and JackrabbitAccessControlEntry. While the latter has already been addressed for the 2.2 release,\nI would like to fix the JackrabbitAccessControlList interface as well (and subsequently also fix the implementations that currently do not properly cope with \nnames).\n",
