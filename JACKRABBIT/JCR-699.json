            "body": "Hi,\n\nWhen we want to cluster our application we really need the synchronization of re-registration. My guess is that adding this is not too hard. It seems that two interfaces each need an additional method to communicate the re-registration: NodeTypeEventListener and NodeTypeEventChannel.\nThese additional methods should then be implemented by ClusterNode (implements NodeTypeEventChannel) and by the NodeTypeRegistry (implements NodeTypeEventListener). It seems that the implementation in the ClusterNode can re-use the registered method. The implementation in the NodeTypeRegistry follows the externalRegistered method more or less.\n\nNext, the NodeTyperegistry should inform its eventChannel (the ClusterNode) when a nodetype re-registered in the method reregisterNodeType. Equivalently, the ClusterNode should inform the NodeTypeRegistry from one of its process methods.\n\nIs this really what needs to be done, or are there things that I've overlooked? Thanks!",

            "body": "Thank you for providing your patch, Martijn! I applied it with some small modifications to the serialization/deserialization logic: all other operations that belong to some group use the same character to introduce the record (e.g. 'L' for locking) and I therefore kept the 'T' for nodetype and encoded the type of operation along with the size in order to stay compatible with older versions.\n\nFixed in revision 541585.",
