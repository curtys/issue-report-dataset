Probably really trivial to say is that there is a contrib/spellchecker already present in lucene....but just to be sure I mention it.\n\nFurthermore, if you want to build it from scratch, [1] might be an interesting read,  explaining the basics of how a lucene spellchecker might be developed. It though might be too simple, but instructive if you are just starting with the concepts  :-)\n\n[1] http://today.java.net/lpt/a/211",
