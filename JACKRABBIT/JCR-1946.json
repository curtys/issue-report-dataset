Originally I deployed the same jackrabbit-jca.rar in the dev server, which is single (non-cluster) server environment.  Everything worked great.   However, as soon as I moved to the cluster environment, JCAResourceAdapter just couldn't fit.   Yes, I agree, JCAResourceAdapter must implement Serializable.  Otherwise, it won't be deployable in any cluster environment.     ",

I guess it is another jackrabbit/jcr upgrade issue.  Our current configuration is based on jackrabbit release 1.5.   The following is the repository.xml.
