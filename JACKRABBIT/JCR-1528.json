    "description": "ManageableCollectionUtil has two getManageableCollection methods, which do not currently return a ManageableCollection which wraps Maps. \n\nManagedHashMap already exists in the codebase which I assume was created for this purpose, so both getManageableCollection methods could be modified so that they do something like:\n\n            if (object instanceof Map){\n                return new ManagedHashMap((Map)object);\n            }\n\n\nAn alternative solution might be to modify the JCR mapping to support explicitly defining the 'ManagedXXX' class.",
