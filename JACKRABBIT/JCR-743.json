I have also tested a oracle.jdbc.xa.client.OracleXADataSource\nbut then i get a Exception on commit @see JCR-744\nI have a SessionBean where i make some calls to to Jackrabbit within a Transaction.\n\nI made a clean start. (starting my Server and Jackrabbit to a a empty repository). \nIf i add a node to the repository within transaction there are no problems. \nNow i stop the server and restart it and i get  always the Nullpointer Exception. First i thought that is only if a make a Rollback but that is not so.\nI try to find out why Websphere try to recover the transaction ...\n",

    "description": "If i add a node to the repository i get a XAException because i run into a Timeout ... \nI see the Warn Message: Transaction rolled back because timeout expired.\nThe default Timeout is set to 5 sec and i dont know how to set it to a higher value\nThe Problem is if i restart my server websphere has a RecoveryManager and he try to recover this Transaction\nand then i get a NullpointerException in JCAManagedConnectionFactory. createManagedConnection beacuse the given \nConnectionRequestInfo is null.\nSo i dont know why the RecoveryManager tries to recover the Transaction ? The only solution for me is to delete the Tran-Log Files wich keep Websphere to recvoer\nXA Trasnactions.\n",
