    "description": "While trying to fix JCR-2293 I discovered that CacheBehaviour Observation is broken:\n\n- HierarchyEventListener.onEvent ignores local event (despite the comment saying otherwise). Not sure which way it should be. However with local events being ignored, JCR-2293 will most probably also occur with CacheBehaviour Observation. \n\n- NodeEntryImpl.refresh(Event) does not set its child node entries to incomplete when a node/property was added.\n\n- After tentatively fixing above issues, I discovered that NodeEntryImpl.refresh(Event) and my own event listener operate on different NodeEntryImpl and ChildNodeEntryImpl instances. That is, even though I set childNodeEntries.complete to false in NodeEntryImpl.refresh(Event), when my own event listener retrieves that node (entry), it gets a different instance which has childNodeEntries.complete still set to true.\n",
