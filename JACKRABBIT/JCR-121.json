    "description": "The JCRTest.java file described in the First Steps document (http://incubator.apache.org/jackrabbit/firststeps.html) on the jackrabbit incubator website contains a line that attempts to create a StringValue using new, rather than using the ValueFactory interface. This causes the code to fail to compile - perhaps an initiative test, but could be off-putting...\n\nSimple fix is to swap the line:\n\n n.setProperty(\"testprop\", new StringValue(\"Hello, World.\"));\n\nto \n\nn.setProperty(\"testprop\", session.getValueFactory().createValue(\"Hello, World.\"));\n\n",
