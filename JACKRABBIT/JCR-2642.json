The selected package and image formats are still disabled by explicitly mapping them to the dummy EmptyParser class.",

    "description": "Hi,\n\nI was trying to implement a custom parser and found the following problem.\nSince tika 0.7 it is possible to implement your custom parser and specify it into a service provider configuration file (META-INF/services/org.apache.tika.parser.Parser). In this way there would be no need to maintain a custom tika-config.xml file if you'd like to implement a custom parser.\n\nThe problem that I had was in the JackrabbitParser because I wasn't able to instantiate the AutoDetectParser with the default constructor is will be instantiated using the default TikaConfig constructor.\nBasically from tika 0.7, the TikaConfig.getTikaConfig() is instantiating the TikaConfig using the default constructor instead of accessing the tika-config.xml file from withing the package, and reads the service provider configuration files and populate the parsers map.\n\nWhat I'm proposing is to change the JackrabbitParser to instantiate the AutoDetectParser using the default constructor, in this way the using tika version >= 0.7 we could easily implement our own parsers and there won't be a reason to maintain the tika-config.xml, also a sort of \"backward\" compatibility would be maintained because using the AutoDetectParser default constructor the TikaConfig is instantiated using TikaConfig.getTikaConfig() wich for tika versions < 0.7 calls the TikaConfig(InputStream) constructor whcih reads the configuration directly from the package.\n\nBasically the JackrabbitParser should look like this:\n\n    public JackrabbitParser() {\n            \tparser = new AutoDetectParser();\n    }\n \nThanks,\nDan",
