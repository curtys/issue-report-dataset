    "description": "As I noted previously on the dev-list (http://markmail.org/search/?q=amazon+list%3Aorg.apache.jackrabbit.dev#query:amazon%20list%3Aorg.apache.jackrabbit.dev+page:1+mid:qw27gopsn4lnbde5+state:results) I have written an Amazon S3 bundle persistence manager for Jackrabbit. I want to submit the code for the sandbox, the full source is included in the zip file. Licensed under the ASF.\n\nThe project also aims to implement a normal persistence manager (which I abandoned in favor of the more efficient bundle pm, which is implemented, but does not work 100%), a file system impl for S3 (only rough structure present) and an SPI impl that connects to S3 (dreaming ;-)). For more infos, I will include the README.txt of the project here:\n\n=================================================================\nWelcome to Jackrabbit persistence for Amazon Webservices (ie. S3)\n=================================================================\n\nThis module contains various persistence options for using\nAmazon Webservices as backend for Jackrabbit / JCR. Amazon has\ntwo persistence services: S3 (public) and SimpleDB (still beta).\nThe following options are available/ideas:\n\n- (1) persistence managers that connects to S3\n      (normal + bundle, in work, probably not very efficient)\n      \n- (2) persistence manager that connects to SimpleDB\n      (NOT feasible)\n      \n- (3) SPI implementation that connects to S3\n      (not implemented, very complicated, probably more efficient)\n      \nSee details below and also TODO.txt\n\n\nInstalling / Testing\n====================\n\nThis needs a patched Jackrabbit 1.3.x version. The patches can\nbe found in the directory \"patches-for-1.3\". One patch will modify\nthe pom of jackrabbit-core to generated the jackrabbit test jar\nfor reuse in this project. To build that customized version, you need\nto do the following steps:\n\n1) svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/branches/1.3 jackrabbit-1.3\n2) cd jackrabbit-1.3\n3) apply all patches from the \"patches-for-1.3\" directory:\n   patch -p0 < %JR-AMAZON-PATH%/patches-for-1.3/%PATCH%.patch\n4) mvn install\n5) cd %JR-AMAZON-PATH%\n6) change jackrabbit version number in pom.xml to the one you just built\n   (eg. project/parent/version = 1.3.4)\n7) cp aws.properties.template aws.properties\n8) enter your credentials in aws.properties\n9) mvn test\n\nFor debugging, you can change the logging in applications/test/log4j.properties\nand set up proxying (for monitoring the traffic with eg. tcp mon) in\napplications/test/jets3t.properties.\n\n\nDetails about Implementations\n=============================\n\n(1) org.apache.jackrabbit.persistence.amazon.AmazonS3PersistenceManager\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/s3\n\nStores JCR Nodes and Properties inside S3 Objects. Uses UUID for Nodes and\nUUID/Name for Properties as Object names. Node references are stored\nvia references/UUID.\n\nConfiguration parameters:\n\naccessKey\n    Amazon AWS access key (aka account user id) [required]\n\nsecretKey\n    Amazon AWS secret key (aka account password) [required]\n    \nbucket\n    Name of the S3 bucket to use [optional, default uses accessKey]\n    Note that bucket names are global, so using your accessKey is\n    recommended to prevent conflicts with other AWS users. \n    \nobjectPrefix\n    Prefix used for all object names [optional, default is \"\"]\n    Should include the workspace name (\"${wsp.name}\" or \"version\" for\n    the versioning PM) to put multiple workspaces into one bucket.\n\nExample XML Config:\n\n<PersistenceManager class=\"org.apache.jackrabbit.persistence.amazon.AmazonS3PersistenceManager\">\n    <param name=\"accessKey\"    value=\"abcde01234\"/>\n    <param name=\"secretKey\"    value=\"topsecret\"/>\n    <param name=\"bucket\"       value=\"abcde01234.jcrstore\"/>\n    <param name=\"objectPrefix\" value=\"${wsp.name}/\"/>\n</PersistenceManager>\n\n-----\n\n(2) AmazonSimpleDBPersistenceManager\n\nThis is *not* feasible because of the restrictions that are applied\nto SimpleDB. An item can only have up to 256 attributes, each attribute\ncan only contain a string value and that one can only have 1024 chars.\nSee this link for more information:\n\nhttp://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonSimpleDB/2007-11-07/DeveloperGuide/SDB_API_PutAttributes.html\n\n-----\n\n(3) org.apache.jackrabbit.spi2s3\n\nTODO\n\nlots of work...\n\n\nAbout\n=====\n\nIt was originally written by Alexander Klimetschek\n(alexander.klimetschek at googlemail dot com) in 2008.\n\nSee the Apache Jackrabbit web site (http://jackrabbit.apache.org/)\nfor documentation and other information. You are welcome to join the\nJackrabbit mailing lists (http://jackrabbit.apache.org/mail-lists.html)\nto discuss this component and to use the Jackrabbit issue tracker\n(http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCR) to report issues or request\nnew features.\n\nApache Jackrabbit is a project of the Apache Software Foundation\n(http://www.apache.org).\n",
