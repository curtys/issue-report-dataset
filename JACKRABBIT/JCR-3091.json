If your implementation cannot efficiently determine that it should exhaust, it is recommended that you check for that value in each call to this method.\"\n\nNone of the scorer implementations does that currently. Except for ChildAxisScorer thanks to JCR-3082.\n\nThis is a worthwhile effort, which can save us from bugs (JCR-3082) but also leverage some performance optimisation hints from the lucene api.",
