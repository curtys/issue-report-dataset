I find the following easy to use and manage: The sample apps in the test source tree (maybe better add an 'examples' tree) that write to System.out. Then for each of those sample apps add a test that redirects System.out to a ByteArrayOutputStream, calls the main method, checks if the output is correct. Like that the sample apps don't get out of sync. I will open a new issue about that.",
