I also added a method getRecords() without parameters, which allows one to walk the whole journal.\n\nAn event journal can only be obtained by a session that contains the AdminPrincipal. Regular access right checks seems inappropriate because there are cases where lots of additional information would be required. E.g. consider a newly created user. Does he have access to past events? How do you find out which events were created before the user was created? etc.",
