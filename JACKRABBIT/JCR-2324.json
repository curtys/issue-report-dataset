That was not a problem with Mutex since there release() was idempotent. I think this is different with Semaphore. \n\n",

I get lots of node type related errors when running tests in jackrabbit-spi2jcr. might be related to the replacement of ConcurrentReaderHashMap with ConcurrentHashMap, which is not exactly the same. It seems some tests now pick a different node type than before because the iteration order is different with the patch applied.",
