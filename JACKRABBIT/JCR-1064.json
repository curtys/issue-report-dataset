            "body": "I like the patch so far. Just a few comments:\n\nLuceneQueryBuilder: \n- I would rename getMatchAllQuery() to createMatchAllQuery() to make clear that a new instance is created\n- I think it's not a valid option to imply the new index format in the old createQuery() variant. I would rather imply the old index format since this will works with the new index as well (until now). But the optimal solution would be to remove this methods. Let's wait what Marcel says.\n\nSearchIndex:\n- You seem to have called \"Organize Imports\". If you could adjust the import order to Jackrabbits order this would make the diff smaller\n- I would rewrite the format check to:\n\n        // The index is in the new format if either the index already contains\n        // the field FieldNames.PROPERTIES_SET in any document or if the index\n        // is empty\n        Collection allFieldNames = index.getIndexReader().getFieldNames(\n          \t             FieldOption.ALL);\n        newIndexFormat = allFieldNames.contains(FieldNames.PROPERTIES_SET)\n       \t                 || index.getIndexReader().numDocs() == 0;\n\n        if (!newIndexFormat) {\n            log.warn(\"Index is in old format. This might imply slower queries.\"\n                    + \"Re-index if possible\");\n        }\n\nMy line was actually just a quick example. I think it's more readable if it is split into two lines at least. The other point is that I prefer to always enclose if-blocks with curly braces. This is less error prone when adding new statements to the block.\n\nOverall you should take care of using spaces instead of tabs everywhere. In case you use eclipse just edit your formatter preferences for that particular project and do <Ctrl>+I on the sections in question. This will re-indent those sections.\n\nSounds like a lot of critics but I really like and appreciate your work!",

That means you have to close the returned reader when you are done checking the index version.\n",

            "body": "Aaah I am sorry for the system.out. I replaced a patch and did put a sysout.out. Stupid, I'll remove it! I'll do the other 4 (-) as well.\n\nAbout the parent handler I knew that the system index can be in the old format, but AFAICS, this is never an issue. When I am searching an index for workspace X, it does not matter wether the parent index is in the old format I think (I am doing the tests, with the parent index in old format, and the workspace index in new format, and this is no problem)\n\nAs I see your example:\n\nA user may do the following:\n- Upgrate a pre 1.4 repository (-> all indexes are V1)\n- Re-index a workspace (-> workspace index will be V2)\n- Execute a query on the workspace (-> will use V2 for queries) \n\nthis will just run fine, as I tested it this way. You can have workspaces with old index style along with new index style, as with a system index in new or old format. \n\nIt is hard to get it nice backwards compatible, due to the index creation in the MultiIndex when there is no index.\n\nFor example, when in SearchIndex.doInit() the following line is executed\n\nindex = new MultiIndex(indexDir, this, context.getItemStateManager(),\n                context.getRootId(), excludedIDs, nsMappings);\n\nthe system index is created. Because this is *before* the setIndexFormatVersion part in doInit(), in NodeIndexer this part\n\nif(indexFormatVersion == IndexFormatVersion.V2) {\n               addPropertyName(doc,propState.getName());\n}\n\nwill never be called since indexFormatVersion  == null. This means, the system index is always indexed without the PROPERTIES_SET, and therefor always in the old format. \n\nNow, I did just test to first set the default indexformat before the new MultiIndex, like:\n\nsetIndexFormatVersion(IndexFormatVersion.V2);\nindex = new MultiIndex(indexDir, this, context.getItemStateManager(),\n               context.getRootId(), excludedIDs, nsMappings);\n\nwhich later in doInit might be set to V1\n\nso when a new index is created here, I get an index with the PROPERTIES_SET. But...I do not know wether the new MultiIndex(...) creation also indexes after it already exists, so that it might index  PROPERTIES_SET, while it should be in old format. Hope I am a little clear on the problems? :-)\n\nI'll re-add the patch with your first 4 (-)  solved and wait if you can comment on my thing about the parent handler,\n\nthanks for reviewing :-) \n\n\n\n\n",

There is a subtle difficulty though:\n\nWhen I have one sysIndex and 2 workspace indices in format style like:\n\nsysIndex = old\nws1Index = old\nws2Index = old\n\nnow, only deleting the sysIndex, will generate a sysIndex in new format style in index.createInitialIndex(). \n\nSince ws1Index and ws2Index  are old, the parentQueryHandler should be set to old index style again. This is implemented. \n\nNow, when you would have again \n\nsysIndex = old\nws1Index = old\nws2Index = old\n\nand remove sysIndex  *and*  ws1Index, then  at doInit() we would get \n\nsysIndex = new --> old  (but changed to old when ws2Index is initialised)\nws1Index = new\nws2Index = old\n\nbut, when querying ws1Index, this might give problems, because sysIndex is reverted to \"old\" when ws2Index was initialized. To solve this, at getIndexFormatVersion() always a check is done wether parent handler and current index format are the same. If not, default back to old style.\n\nThis implies, that when updating jackrabbit version, you will *only* get the new indexing format style if and only if you re-index all the existing indices you have so far. \n\nHope my explanation is clear!
