But the problem is that I'm not sure if that the test is actually ok: NamespaceRemappingTest.testExceptionOnUnknownPrefix(NamespaceRemappingTest.java:174) [1].\nIt relies on session.propertyExists to throw an exception if a property does not exist, but the api [2] states that is will throw an exception only if the path is \"not a well-formed absolute path\"\n\nSo in the case where you have a well-formed absolute path that does not exist, you'll still get an error, which does not feel right. We can fix that too, but then the test [1] will break.\n\n\n[0] https://builds.apache.org/job/Jackrabbit-trunk/org.apache.jackrabbit$jackrabbit-core/1580/testReport/junit/org.apache.jackrabbit.test.api/NamespaceRemappingTest/testExceptionOnUnknownPrefix/\n[1] http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/jackrabbit/trunk/jackrabbit-jcr-tests/src/main/java/org/apache/jackrabbit/test/api/NamespaceRemappingTest.java?view=markup\n[2] http://www.day.com/maven/javax.jcr/javadocs/jcr-2.0/javax/jcr/Session.html#propertyExists(java.lang.String)\n",
