To avoid breaking the functionality entirely for such users, I introduced a -DdisableCheckForReferencesInContentException=true feature flag in in trunk revision 1236709 and merged it also to the 2.2 and 2.1 branches. Setting that system property will restore the earlier broken behavior where the exception from checkForReferencesInContent() was disabled.",
