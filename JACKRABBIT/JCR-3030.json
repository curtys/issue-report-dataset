Affects :\n- org.apache.jackrabbit.core.fs.db.OracleFileSystem\n- org.apache.jackrabbit.core.journal.OracleDatabaseJournal\n- org.apache.jackrabbit.core.persistence.pool.OraclePersistenceManager\nand associated oracle.ddl resources.\n\nThe old \"tableSpace\" replacement variable is replaced with \"tableTablespace\" and \"indexTablespace\" variables and matching getters/setters.\n\nAlso included are two unit tests :\n- org.apache.jackrabbit.core.fs.db.OracleFileSystemTest, similar to DerbyFileSystemTest\n- org.apache.jackrabbit.core.OracleRepositoryTest with org.apache.jackrabbit.core.repository-oracle.xml : starts and logins to a transient repository using the three classes above.\nBoth unit tests expect a bunch of system properties to retrieve the database connection parameters. I chose not to hardcode them as I have no idea of what databases are available to CI builds.",

The only thing I'd like to see added before we commit this is restoring backwards compatibility with existing repository configurations. For example, if someone has already configured a repository with the current tableSpace parameter, it should automatically be used for both the new tablespace variables instead of throwing a configuration error as it would with the proposed patch.",
