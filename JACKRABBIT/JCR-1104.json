            "body": "In preparation for the switch to JCR 2.0, I've attached the POM file that can be used with the JCR API jar file found in the JSR 283 proposed final draft (PFD).\n\nThe dependency setting for this jar will be:\n\n    <dependency>\n      <groupId>javax.jcr</groupId>\n      <artifactId>jcr</artifactId>\n      <version>2.0-pfd</version>\n    </dependency>\n\nThis jar is *not* available on the central Maven repository, so you'll need to install it manually to your local repository. To do that, download the JSR 283 PFD package and the POM file attached here, and install them with the following command:\n\n    mvn install:install-file -Dfile=/path/to/lib/jcr-2.0.jar -DpomFile=/path/to/pom.xml\n",

            "body": "Attached an updated version of the JCR 2.0 API jar (jcr-2.0-b15.jar). This version fixes some issues reported against the PFD version and is expected to better match the upcoming final jcr-2.0.jar. The b15 version number is based on internal version control and will change for any further updates we need to do. We should update Jackrabbit to use this API jar instead of the earlier PFD version.\n\nI've also included a POM file (jcr-2.0-b15.jar) to be used when uploading the API jar to your local Maven repository. It should replace the jcr-2.0-pfd.xml POM file we currently have in trunk.\n\nNote that the jcr-2.0-b15.jar attached here is explicitly *not* meant to be included in Jackrabbit svn or Jackrabbit releases. It is made available for evaluation purposes under similar terms as the PFD jar from jcp.org.",
