The second one being invoked will block for 5 seconds because the WorkspaceInfo has already been locked by the first one. Eventually, the second (internal) transaction will be rolled back and the whole transaction fails.\n\nYour patch will eliminate this double-locking, but in turn may lead to 2 (or more) XASessions concurrently updating shared state, which might result in corruption, see JCR-335 for more details.\n\nIn order to fix this problem, the individual updates (on prepare) should probably be more thoroughly inspected to detect clashes, and, if none occurs, allow them. This would work for your usecase at least, since one of your sessions makes no update at all.",

            "body": "I completely agree that your scenario is a viable one. There is just one small problem: from your logging output I deduce that there are actually two active TransactionContext instances: one named TransactionContext@50a950a9, the other one TransactionContext@a460a46 (package names omitted for brevity). This implies that their respective XIDs are different and this makes it hardly detectable for JR's internal transaction manager to relate them.\n\nAs far as I understand, the \"Admin\" session is created by your custom AccessManager to check whether the user represented by your normal \"User\" session is actually allowed to do what he tries to. When starting a repository that will itself register in the by JNDI namespace or in the RMI registry, a custom AccessManager will be able get a reference back to the actual repository being queried. In the JCA case, this is probably something that is missing, because getting an \"Admin\" session through JCA - and thereby creating a second transaction - looks like overkill to me.",

Your access manager shouldn't resort to logging in via JCA connection factory and thereby starting another transaction, but should rather be somehow given access to the repository itself, or better still, a system session to get ACL information.\n\nHonestly, I think that simply ignoring the branch id when identifying transactions will most definitely lead to problems in other situations and/or with other application servers. According to the DTP XA specification [1], section 7.2, Resource Manager Requirements:\n\n  An RM can use the bqual component of the XID structure to let different branches of the same global transaction prepare to commit at \n  different times, and to avoid deadlock (see Section 4.2 on page 19).\n\nIn other words, Jackrabbit might detect this situation and rearrange the order of operations, but there still remains the non-trivial task of identifying potential conflicts.\n\n[1] Distributed Transaction Processing: The XA specification (http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009680699/)",

I have already changed my code (without a session in my accessmanager) a few days before and now i have not anymore problems with the xa transaction.\nAlthough i have tested the behaviour with two sessions in one transaction because i think the current implemention can not work with two sessions in one transaction\nconcerning more factors.\n\nThe first is that the WorkspaceInfo acquires a exclusiv lock. As you can see on the above trace that i have only one transactioncontext object involved in the transaction\nbut this solves not the problem because every session gets prepared and so the workspaceinfo object will be prepared two times !\n\nThe second thing is the XID in combination with the txGlobal Map.\nI have read the specification and as you say we can not ignore the branch id. As i understand the branchid it is used to differentiate the xaresources in one distributed transaction.\nIn our use case the 2 xasessionimpl's are these branches and so they can not be the same.\nSo you will never find a TransactionContext Object with the XID as Key in  the txGlobal Map in a global Transaction.\nI have found a good documentation about the use of branches (http://download-west.oracle.com/docs/cd/B10501_01/java.920/a96654/xadistra.htm)\nAs they write\n[When you use XA functionality, the transaction manager uses XA resource instances to prepare and coordinate each transaction branch and then to commit or roll back all transaction branches appropriately] \nor\n[The \"prepare\" step is the first step of a two-phase COMMIT operation. The transaction manager will issue a prepare to each XA resource instance. Once the transaction manager sees that the operations of each transaction branch have prepared successfully, it will issue a COMMIT to each XA resource instance to commit all the changes]\n\nThe XASessionImpl implements the XAResource so it is a branch or not ?\n\nIn the specification under 4.2 is written\n[The only requirement is that both gtrid and bqual, taken together, must be globally unique.]\n\nSo maybe i am wrong otherwise please tell me how you see that things",

But fixing the problem is not simply a matter of replacing the exclusive lock obtained in TX1B1.prepare with a more \"concurrency-friendy\" one, but one would have to eventually merge the changes in TX1B1 and TX2B2 and detect potential conflicts, which is far more complicated and currently not implemented.\n\nIn other words: this bug is absolutely legitimate, but in your situation one can work around it.",

To illustrate my point, let's assume the following situation:\n\nTX1B1: User \"joe\" makes some change to the repository\nTX2B2: User \"fred\" makes some other change to the repository\n\nCurrently, committing transaction TX1 as a whole will lock for some time and eventually fail, as we know. Changing the way XIDs are mapped, would perform all operations as \"joe\" or \"fred\", whoever comes first, because they are stored as attributes of the TransactionContext. You can not easily switch to a TransactionContext that remembers changes made by several users.\n\nHonestly, I do appreciate your eagerness to have this problem fixed, but again, it is not a simple matter of changing the way XIDs are mapped to TransactionContexts (or when to delete them) that will make the whole thing work.",

Of course, one could also map an XAResource to all changes made inside a global transaction (including all branches) but that still leaves the problem of integrating all changes made by all users in that transaction.\n\n> For me its clear that the process is not easy and maybe a long term but if you think its is not importand to identify the problems, ok let it be.\n\nSorry for having made that impression.
