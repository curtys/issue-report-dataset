How about simply logging all relevant information at a high enough log level (WARN) or perhaps moving the broken child node reference to somewhere like the /jcr:system/lost+found tree that was proposed already earlier?",

I know it's not a \"real\" unit test case yet (I will change that later on).\n\nThe solution doesn't try to solve all possible edge cases. It's just a simple solution for the most common problems. For edge cases we can use the existing consistency check and fix. This is just for the most common cases, for old repositories where it was relatively easy to get corruptions. I believe with more recent versions of Jackrabbit it's very hard to get corruptions. At least, that's the plan - if it's not the case yet then I believe we should spend most of our time in hardening Jackrabbit, and not in automatically fixing problems :-)",

            "body": "thanks for the patch, a few comments:\n\n- i like the idea of automatically fixing inconsistencies when they're encountered;\n  however, i am a bit concerned that the corresponding warnings in the log \n  don't get noticed and the user might be unaware of a repository becoming gradually \n  corrupt. i suggest to control the proposed behavior through a flag (e.g. a system property),\n  and that this feature is disabled by default.\n\n- there's a potential problem in the patched addNode() method.\n\n+            // loop until we either find an existing child node,\n+            // or we are sure no such child node exists\n+            ChildNodeEntry cne = thisState.getChildNodeEntry(nodeName, 1);\n+            existing = null;\n+            if (cne != null) {\n+                try {\n+                    existing = itemMgr.getNode(cne.getId(), getNodeId());\n+                } catch (ItemNotFoundException e) {\n+                    // the item was removed in the persistence manager,\n+                    // which is a repository inconsistency - there is nothing\n+                    // we can do, so the child node entry is removed now\n+                    log.warn(\"Node \" + getPath() + \"/\" + cne.getName() + \" \" +\n+                            \"(index \" + cne.getIndex() + \", id \" + cne.getId() +\n+                            \"parent id \" + getId() + \") \" +\n+                            \"not found; removing\", e);\n+                    removeChildNode(cne.getId());\n+                    continue;\n+                }\n+            }\n \n  the existence is checked through the ItemManager which \n  depends on access control, i.e. an ItemNotFoundException might \n  be thrown because the current session is not allowed to read \n  that particular node...\n  ",

    "description": "If a node points to a non-existing child node (which is a repository inconsistency), currently this child node is silently ignored for read operations (as far as I can tell). However, when trying to add another child node with the same name, an exception is thrown with a message saying a child node with this name already exists. Also, the parent node can't be removed.\n\nOne solution is to remove the bad child node entry, but only if the session attribute \"org.apache.jackrabbit.autoFixCorruptions\" is set (so by default the repository is not changed 'secretly'):\n\n    SimpleCredentials cred = new SimpleCredentials(...);\n    cred.setAttribute(\"org.apache.jackrabbit.autoFixCorruptions\", \"true\");\n    rep.login(cred);\n\nIt's not a perfect solution, but it might be better than throwing an exception and basically preventing changes.\n\nAnother solution (not implemented) would be to rename the missing child node entry when trying to add a child node with the same name (for example add the current date/time, or a random digit until there is no conflict), and then continue with adding the new child node.\n\n",
