            "body": "Hello,\n\nI started working on this issue and I have some ideas that I would like to discuss here. To cut a long story short, I think of implementing this configuration as a set of rules for including/excluding elements. Before adding node to index the rules should be checked and indexing engine should apply to first rule this node matches.\n\nI think of storing this configuration in XML file, and my first thought is workspace.xml and repository.xml (as a template for workspace.xml). XML configuration should look like as follows:\n\n    <!-- ==================== <SearchConfiguration> ======================== -->\n\n    <!--\n        The SearchConfiguration element allows to include/exclude parts of \n        repository from indexing. It is achieved using rules. First rule is\n        the most significant one and the last one (default rule) is the least\n        significant one.\n        If no SearchConfiguration is specified, the default configuration is \n        assumed:\n        <SearchConfiguration>\n          <SearchRule action=\"include\" />\n        </SearchConfiguration>\n    -->\n    <!ELEMENT SearchConfiguration (SearchRule+)>\n\n    <!--\n        The SearchRule element includes/excludes part of repository from \n        indexing. It has one required attributes - action to be taken when node\n        matches this rule - include or exclude this node from indexing. If no\n        other attributes are spefified, all nodes will match this rule.\n        If nodePath is specified - nodes in given path (and below) will match. \n        Any valid java.util.regex regular expression is allowed.\n        If nodeType is specified - nodes of given type will match. Both \n        attributes can be specified at once.\n    -->\n    <!ELEMENT SearchRule (NodeAttribute*)>\n    <!ATTLIST SearchRule\n      nodePath (CDATA) #IMPLIED\n      nodeType (CDATA) #IMPLIED\n      action (include|exclude) #REQUIRED>\n\n    <!--\n        The NodeAttribute element allows to include/exclude attributes of node\n        from indexing. It has one required attributes - action to be taken when \n        attribute matches this rule - include or exclude this attribute from \n        indexing. If no other attributes are spefified, all attributes will \n        match this rule.\n        If attributeName is specified - attributes with given names will match. \n        Any valid java.util.regex regular expression is allowed.\n        If attributeType is specified - attributes of given type will match. \n        Both attributes can be specified at once. If no NodeAttribute is \n        specified for search rule, default configuration is assumed:\n        <NodeAttribute action=\"include\" />\n    -->\n    <!ELEMENT NodeAttribute EMPTY>\n    <!ATTLIST NodeAttribute\n      attributeName (CDATA) #IMPLIED\n      attributeType (CDATA) #IMPLIED\n      action (include|exclude) #REQUIRED>\n\n    <!-- ==================== </SearchConfiguration> ======================= -->\n\nI am waiting for your comments and suggestions.\n\nRegards,\nJan",

            "body": "Yes C\u00e9dric, I find it a good idea to make this configuration as wide as possible, especially that I can easily think of more sophisticated cases (e.g. using decision tree).\n\nIn that case, I'll add two more parameters to SearchConfiguration:\n<!ATTLIST SearchConfiguration\n      class CDATA #IMPLIED \n      configurationFile CDATA #IMPLIED >\nfirst one will allow to force use of different configuration mechanism, and second one to pass configuration file for this specific mechanism.\n\nAlthough I will leave possibility to put configuration into repository.xml.\n\nRegards,\n Jan",

            "body": "There are a couple of issues with the proposed patch:\n\n- The configuration is query handler dependent and should therefore not be prescribed in the repository.xml. The configuration should rather be added as a separate XML file.\n- Completely excluding certain nodes from indexing can have severe side effects because the index depends on each node being indexed to resolve the node hierarchy.\n- Matches of property names do not respect the namespace URI\n- The class NodeStateLocationAware extends from NodeState and adds the path as a fixed value, the path should rather be retrieved from a hierarchy manager.",
