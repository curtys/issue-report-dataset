            "body": "There was some bad assumption in the PathMap (located in jackrabbit-jcr-commons): after moving /node1 to /result, the CachingHierarchyManager determined that its internal representation of the root tnode had become invalid and therefore told its PathMap to remove it. The PathMap has some check to prevent the root node from being completely removed, but unfortunately forgot to remove its children and associated object, which left an orphaned \"node1\" child in the root node's children map.\n\nFixed in revision 542838.",
