For example, it would be almost impossible to make the API externally visible and not at the same time make the implementation visible ...\n\nIMHO this is not a matter of  making \"jackrabbit look better in code quality tools\", it is a matter of good programming style (oh yeah, another one from pandorra's box) supporting separation of concern.",

If not, then there's something wrong with the tools. :-)\n\nAs for why I think moving the Ids to a separate package is especially important for code quality tools: as long as they are in o.a.j.core many tools have trouble identifying circular dependencies and other design issues beyond the obvious o.a.j.core.foo -> o.a.j.core dependencies caused by the Id classes. Creating o.a.j.core.id will not solve those issues, but will at least make them more visible and thus easier to solve.",
