I introduced them to support caching of QName <-> JCR Name conversion. At that time the NamespaceResolver seemed to be the only place where to put the cache. Now that we have a NameFormat and PathFormat we should move the caching mechanism in a subclass of Name/PathFormat. IMO this makes more sense.",

            "body": "i totally agree to remove all QName/Path methods from NamespaceResolver. But moving the caching caps to NameFormat might not be optimal, since it resides in commons and should be as indepdentant from the core as possible (otherwise we would also need to rename all NameFormat.format() to NameFormat.getInstance().format() ....)\n\nhowever, my idea was to have a new interface 'QNameCache' that has simple caching methods. if a namespace resolver implements this interface, NameFormat uses it's cache:\n\nif (resolver instanceof QNameCache) {\n  // check cache, etc....\n}",
