The default behavior of the UserManager can be influenced by setting a couple of options in the security configuration.\n\nFor minimal backwards compatitibility with pre-2.0 user content the 'compatibleJR16' option must be set to true. In this case UserManager#getAuthorizable(String ID) will try to retrieve authorizables using the noderesolver if not found otherwise.\n\nSee UserManagerImpl for further details.",
