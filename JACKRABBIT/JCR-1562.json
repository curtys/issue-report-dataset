For Oracle, a user name and password is required in any case. I think this is a problem, but the best way to solve it is (in my view) to document this change in the release notes.\n\nIf nobody objects, I will commit this change in a few days.",

For Oracle, the file src/main/resources/org/apache/jackrabbit/core/persistence/bundle/oracle.ddl file is used. It doesn't have to do with the database schema.\n\nSee also http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCR-1180",

The Oracle JDBC driver requires user name and password. If that's configured in the data source then that's OK.\n\n",

This works for some but not all provided PersistenceManagers. Some of them - like the Oracle-specific BundleDBPersistenceManager - sets default values for user and password if none are provided in the jackrabbit config. This way its impossible to use such PersistenceManagers with the plain JNDI DS.\n\nThis concerns the following BundleDbPersistenceManagers: OraclePersistenceManager, DerbyPersistenceManager, H2PersistenceManager.\n\nThere also might be other PMs (perhaps some special SimpleDbPersistenceManagers) with similar behaviour.",
