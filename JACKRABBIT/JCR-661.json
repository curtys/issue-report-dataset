I forgot to remove the tools.jar dependency from jackrabbit-jcr-rmi/pom.xml in revision 482149 when I added the dependency in trunk/pom.xml. The profiles in trunk/pom.xml of course didn't affect the remaining dependency setting in jackrabbit-jcr-rmi/pom.xml.\n\nIt should be possible to fix the issue by restoring the profile settings in trunk/pom.xml (reverting 48344) and removing the extra dependency from jackrabbit-jcr-rmi/pom.xml. The profiles in jackrabbit-jcr-rmi/pom.xml introduced in 48344 should not be needed after that.",
