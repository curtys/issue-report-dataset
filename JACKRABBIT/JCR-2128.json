A few remarks: \n\n1) Originally I wanted to use the same class (DbDataStore) for all databases to simplify configuration (and maybe implementation). But in this case it makes sense to use a different class.\n\n2) super.close(); is called twice in your patch. I added a remark: \"need to call it again because we just opened a connection, and super.close() closes it.\"\n",
