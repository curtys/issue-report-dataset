I've now committed the ChainedDecoratorFactory class and the RepositoryDecorator changes along with other pending JCR-EXT changes.\n\nComments about the other classes:\n\nEventListenerDecoratorFactory - This might be better implemented as a RepositoryDecorator that overrides the login() method. The attached ZIP is also missing the referenced EventListenerDefinition class.\n\nSessionListenerDecoratorFactory - As above, this might be better implemented as a RepositoryDecorator.\n\nFullChainedDecoratorFactory - I don't see the use case for this class. Why/how would you use this?\n",

            "body": "FullChainedDecorator makes sense when you have more decorators.  A decorator contains a level of decorators (a repository decorator, a session, workspace and so on) and through the factory, the calls are made between components of the same level (same factory) - a repository login for example will return session decorator through it's factory.\nWhen one uses multiple decorators factories (which most of the times are unaware of each others) you need a way to make sure the decorators before the current 'level' are executed (as the chain implementation only delegates to the factories which are after the current level).\n\nThrough FullChainedDecoratorFactory you have the topOfChain member (or utility methods) which can guarantee that the full chain will be used for the decoration of the new element returned.\nExample:\nConsider factory A which decorates the only some session methods (like getLockMethods) and factory B which decorates the repository and the session returned by login. If you are using the normal\nchained factory the call to the repository is not decorated by factory A hits factory B, which decorated the login for example and return the decorated session from A but without the decorated session from A. By using the full chained factory, inside the decorated repository A on login method chainedFactory.getSessionDecorator can be removed with\ntopOfChain.getSessionDecorator - which will use all session decorators inside the chain (including A).\nIt's the difference between using the session decorators from this point on and apply all the decorators on this chain.\n\nAn alternative would be at level A to create a repository decorator which overrides login method to make sure it will apply the session decorator.\n\nI implemented this factory because Session, Repository, Workspaces are related to each other but I wanted to create decorators only for the components I'm interested in not also in the ones that returned them (maybe I was/am confused by the 'calling' points to the JCR entities - (for example to a session can be obtain by Session.impersonate or by Repository.login).",

            "body": "Re: NoOpDecoratorFactory.java\n\nThere's a subtle reason for the DecoratorFactory interface and the functioning of some of the decorator methods. To decorate the entire JCR API you need to manage the various back-references between the decorated instances. For example the decorated Session.getRepository() method should return the *decorated* repository instance, not just the repository reference returned by the underlying session:\n\n    Repository repository = decoratorFactory.getRepositoryDecorator(...);\n    Session session = repository.login();\n    assertTrue(repository == session.getRepository());\n\nThe DecoratorFactory implementation should make sure that all returned decorators honor this contract. The SimpleDecoratorFactory class binds the individiual decorator base classes together to implement the decorator layer for the entire JCR API. Thus the SimpleDecoratorFactory (or the ChainedDecoratorFactory) should always be used as a base class when adding custom decorator classes to the decorator layer.\n\nThus I see little use for the NoOpDecoratorFactory. Instead of doing NoOpDecoratorFactory.getRepositoryDecorator(repository) you could always just use the repository instance directly.\n",
