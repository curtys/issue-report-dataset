            "body": "While looking at this for some other bug, I found some issues with this fix. For example, if i create three nested nodes (eg. hello/world/jackrabbit) like this:\n\nNode root = session.getRootNode(); \n\nNode hello = root.addNode(\"hello\");\nsession.save();\n\nNode world = hello.addNode(\"world\"); \nsession.save(); \n\nNode jackrabbit = world.addNode(\"jackrabbit\"); \nsession.save();\n\nI see the following in the logs for the three saves:\n\nrevision 1 admin@\nrevision 2 admin@\nrevision 3 admin@/hello[24]\n\nThe problem with this is:\n1- Not sure what \"admin@\" means. I think this should be \"admin@ / \" to signify that something is written to the root.\n2- Even though \"world\" node was added under \"hello\" node, it shows up as being added to root in revision 2. \n3- Even though \"jackrabbit\" node was added under \"world\" node, it shows up as being added to \"hello\" node in revision 3.\n\nI think the logs should look like this:\n\nrevision 1 admin@/\nrevision 2 admin@/hello[25]\nrevision 3 admin@/hello[25]/world",
