            "body": "Proposed patch\n\nExample usage:\n\n // Create a new TreeManager instance rooted at node. Splitting of nodes takes place\n // when the number of children of a node exceeds 40 and is done such that each new\n // node has at least 40 child nodes. The keys are ordered according to the natural\n // order of java.lang.String.\n TreeManager treeManager = new BTreeManager(node, 20, 40, Rank.<String>comparableComparator(), true);\n\n // Create a new NodeSequence with that tree manager\n NodeSequence nodes = ItemSequence.createNodeSequence(treeManager);\n\n // Add nodes with key \"jcr\" and \"day\"\n nodes.addNode(\"jcr\", NodeType.NT_UNSTRUCTURED);\n nodes.addNode(\"day\", NodeType.NT_UNSTRUCTURED);\n\n // Iterate over the node in the sequence.\n // Prints \"day jcr \"\n for (Node n : nodes) {\n     System.out.print(n.getName() + \" \");\n }\n\n // Retrieve node with key \"jcr\"\n Node n = nodes.getItem(\"jcr\");\n\n // Remove node with key \"day\"\n nodes.removeNode(\"day\");\n\nThe nodes in the JCR sub tree are arranged such that any node named x only contains child nodes with names greater or equal to x. The implementation keeps the child nodes in the sub tree ordered if the respective node type supports ordering of child nodes. Ordering is always wrt. to a Comparator on the respective keys. For lexical order this arrangement corresponds to how words are arranged in a multi volume encyclopedia.\n\n",

Such an utility should:\n\n- expose a large number of nodes/properties as sequence\n- parametrize the order of how nodes/properties appear in the sequence\n- provide methods to lookup/add/remove nodes/properties by key \n- organize the node/properties in the underlying JCR hierarchy in a way which is both efficient for above operations and easily understandable to users looking at the hierarchy.
