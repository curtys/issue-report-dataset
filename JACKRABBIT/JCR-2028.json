            "body": "Initial proposal for the identifier-based path attempting to incorporate that extension into the general path handling used with both jackrabbit-core and jsr2spi. Main goal was to avoid spreading identifier-path handling through the core/jcr2spi code but instead having it localized in a single place.\n\nThis implies from my point of view the following if we want to stick with the current path handling:\n\n- Normalization of identifier-based paths is defined to be its replacement by a root-based\n  absolute path, which depends on an Session that is able to resolve id to path.\n  Since the Path object we are having is uncoupled from any Session, normalization of\n  identifier-based paths must occur before the Path object is created.\n\n- PATH values on the other hand need to preserve there standard from as entered.\n  Immediate normalization to the an absolute path consisting of qualified name segments is \n  not desired (not allowed). Which means that the internal representation of the jcr path \n  must be able to deal with identifier-segments.\n\nThis lead to the following changes:\n\n- Path may consist of a single IdentifierElement\n- Path has additional method 'denotesIdentifier'\n- Path.Element can be created from an identifier (which currently is String) and gets a\n  method to determine if a given element is an identifier-element.\n  The validation of the id (same as with jcr name) is left to the parser.\n\n- PathParser is extended to handle identifier-based paths upon demand:\n  > validation of the format without requirement that the normalization would succeed.\n  > normalization that requires that a Node exists with that identifier.\n- Introduction of a IdentifierResolver: \n  Used to convert identifier-based paths to a normalized path and validate the validity \n  of an identifier during parsing.\n- PathResolver: additional method getQPath(String jcrPath, boolean normalizeIdentifier)\n  that allows to trigger normalization of identifiers before creating the path objects.\n  the existing method without the flag by default resolves identifier-based path or throws if\n  no IdentifierResolver present (i.e. identifier-based not supported -> path syntax invalid)\n\n- The changes required to make core/jcr2spi properly deal with identifier-based paths\n  where ever normalization is required (API calls except for values generation) seemed \n  to be straight forward (and very limited)... (not included in the patches).\n\nStill I came accross of the following issues, which I didn't address yet, since i wanted\nto get some input regarding the overall approach before digging into the details here.\n\nIssues:\n\n- In order to properly validate the format of PATH values the ValueFactory will have a\n  dependency to the implementation that defines the format of the identifiers.\n  This was straight forward with the ValueFactory present in spi-commons and thus with\n  jcr2spi that consistently uses the ValueFactory defined on the Session object.\n\n- In jackrabbit-core the session's valuefactory is rarely used. Instead instance\n  of the jcr-commons ValueFactory are used, which is neither enabled to standardize\n  expanded name-segments nor able to deal with identifiers.\n\n- In the InternalValue the Value objects are even created directly without make use of \n  any ValueFactory... this seems to cause troubles in contrast to jcr2spi where all\n  jcr and internal values are handled/created by the factories exposed by the Session.\n\nNotes about the identifier path elements:\n\n- I first thought about forcing the identifier-element be constructed from an ItemID \n  instead of a simple String, but dropped that again... for simplicity of the initial proposal...\n  and because I wasn't totally convinced if it would be any beneficial.\n\nThe tests included in the 3rd attachement are just for completeness (TCK) and to have them saved away. Failing at the moment due to missing functionality in core/jcr2spi.\n\nangela\n",

            "body": "Value handling in jackrabbit-core:\n\nI spent some time with the issues listed above and came to the conclusion that we should take a similar approach\nas in jcr2spi: Instead of using the commons ValueFactory and creating the Value objects manually in the InternalValue,\nthe jackrabbit-core should have it's own ValueFactory implementation that creates value objects directly based on the InternalValue. With some minor effort this could be based on code already present in spi-commons (ValueFactoryQImpl, QValueValue created by Julian some time ago), which would be beneficial for the conversion from JCR-value to InternalValue and vice versa... those are already used within jackrabbit-core query-row somewhere.\n\nI will prepare a patch and upload it here as soon as possible.\n\n\n",

Maybe the implementation of addPathValue change, and the method sometimes does throw an exception. What about converting the RepositoryException to a RuntimeException instead?\n\n+        if (value == null) {\n+            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"null value\");\n+        }\n         if (USE_DATA_STORE) {\n             return new InternalValue(BLOBInResource.getInstance(value));\n         }\n\nI would prefer a NullPointerException in that case. Could this be simplified, for example using a method 'checkNull'? Or moved the check to the constructor to avoid copy&paste?\n\n-        val = new Long(value);\n-        type = PropertyType.LONG;\n+        super(new Long(value));\n\nNow that we can use Java 1.5, we should use Long.valueOf(...) because it has a cache.\n\nDid you overload equals without overloading hashCode? That's dangerous, it might break hash tables.\n",

Therefore the changes made may introduce bugs that were not detected by the existing tests...
