    "description": "1) Improvement :\nI need to be able to detect when a bean is an OCM proxy and if it has already been loaded. This kind of functionnality is for example on Hibernate with Hibernate.isInitialized(Object proxy).\nI have developped something similar : I have modified ProxyManagerImpl so it uses an InvocationHandler instead of a LazyLoader. This way, I make my proxies implement a special interface whose methods are intercepted.\n\n2) Bug :\nIf a BeanConverter is specified, ObjectConverterImpl should pass it to the proxy CallBack instead letting BeanLazyLoader use the default ObjectConverter. I think this is a bug, as the behavior is different is bean property is proxified or not.\n\n3) Improvement :\nIf a jcrType mapped on a java type is specified, ObjectConverterImpl should make a proxy of this type, and not use the the bean property type. This is particularly useful when the bean property type is an interface.\n\nSorry for reporting this as a bundle instead of seperate items, but I developped my patch as a whole.  \nLet me know if you need help on the enclosing patch.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSt\u00e9phane Landelle",
