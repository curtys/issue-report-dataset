            "body": "I agree that using old release of libraries can be painful in an application when you do not have access to separate classloader mechanism (like in OSGI) and you use additional libraries with conflicting dependencies.\n\nI think that upgrading runtime transitive dependencies can be done in the 2.0 development branch as this is a major version upgrade from 1.x.\n\nSo I proposed the following patch for:\n- migrating slf4j dependency from 1.5.3 to 1.5.8\n- migrating commons-collections dependency from 3.1 to 3.2.1 with deprecation modifications [1]\n  this implies a new dependency on commons-beanutils for jackrabbit-core (test) and jackrabbit-webapp\n- migrating commons-beanutils (previously not used but defined in jackrabbit-parent) from 1.7.0 to 1.8.2\n- migrating jetty dependencies from 6.1.14 to 6.1.22\n- migrating xerces dependencies from 2.8.1 to 2.9.0\n- removing unused parent dependencies (commons-digester, commons-lang)\n- remove duplicates servlet-api and jsp-api dependencies\n\nWith this patch applied to trunk build with tests is successful (I just disable the AdministratorTest#testAdminNodeCollidingWithRandomNode test case).\n\nI believe we can also upgrade from commons-httpclient 3.0 to HttpClient 4.0 on jackrabbit-spi2dav with a few modifications.\n\nFor Derby, i agree that upgrading is not safe and must be reviewed by a PersistenceManager expert ;).\n\n[1] http://commons.apache.org/collections/api-release/org/apache/commons/collections/BeanMap.html\n",

It seems it is not listed as dependency in the poms but it is needed by the o.a.j.core.persistence.bundle.H2PersistenceManager. It would be nice to add it to the dependencies (maybe marked as optional) with the most recent stable version (currently 1.2.23).\n\nThis also needs some expert checking that the upgrade is safe with the PersistenceManager.\n",

Instead of the new dependency, I'd rather use a copy of the BeanMap class or refactor the reference away.\n\nI think we can keep using the deprecated BeanMap till migrating to future common-collections 4.0.\nMoreover one of the two places is for one of the jackrabbit-core test cases.\n\nI am not very familiar with maven (more of an Ivy guy ;)) but FWIU the derby dependency is mandatory for jackrabbit-core even if there is no java import of any Derby class (the same apply for H2 or any *PM with a JDBC driver).\nBut when a user pull jackrabbit from maven he must exclude derby if he does not want it (rather than explicitly pulling the JR derby dependency like with Ivy configuration [1]).\nI think that Derby and H2 are pretty much on the same level in jackrabbit-core.\nThis is not the case for jackrabbit-webapp or jackrabbit-standalone where we explicitly want to use a DerbyPM.\n\nAre there specific reasons for this maven configuration?
