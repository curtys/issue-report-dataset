            "body": "I just configured another system to use jackrabbit for the first time and left out the JAAS configuration. I installed the webapp and it ran without any problems... no security exceptions or anything else. I'm thinking of taking the JAAS section out of the docs for the test app since they don't seem to be needed; I think simplicity is key for getting people up and running with a repository to play with.\n\nAt the same time, the JSR 170 spec says very little about how security works inside a JCR repository, and Jackrabbit's documentation on the subject is also rather sparse. I'm not sure if the webapp *should* be working without the jaas.config file and associated JAVA_OPTS environment in place.",

Resolving this issue as fixed though, as the contribution is now in the Jackrabbit tree, and further improvements can be sent as patches attached to new issues.\n\nThanks again, Mark!",
