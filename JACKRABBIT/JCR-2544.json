I tried to identify the source of each failing test and commented\nthe list accordingly. in addition i created a couple of new issues for problem i detected.\n\nwith the changes made i was able to successfully run the ConformanceTest in jackrabbit-jcr2dav.\non my machine it took 7 minutes which is far from being brilliant... anyway... better than not running\nthe tests at all.\n\n",
