    "description": "cadaver was reporting an error when i tried to open / in my repository's default workspace at <https://localhost:8443/webdav/).\n\nin tracking down the problem, i saw something strange - the multistatus response's href had an extra \"/\" tacked onto the end:\n\n  <D:multistatus xmlns:D=\"DAV:\">\n    <D:response>\n      <D:href>https://localhost:8443/webdav//</D:href>\n\nWebdavServlet (rather, my subclass of it) is mapped as the default servlet of a webapp mounted at /webdav. i've configured the WebdavServlet with a resource path prefix of \"\" (incidentally, i'm not sure what that's meant to be used for - i see that when the value is not empty, it's appended to the response's href, but i don't know in what circumstance that would be useful).\n\nwhen i requested a child node such as <https://localhost:8443/webdav/bcm>, the response's href was formed as expected:\n\n  <D:multistatus xmlns:D=\"DAV:\">\n    <D:response>\n      <D:href>https://localhost:8443/webdav/bcm/</D:href>\n\ni found that LocatorFactoryImpl$Locator.getHref() was adding the extra \"/\" since the requested resource was a collection. i patched the method to not add the character when itemPath == \"/\", and cadaver stopped complaining. all is well.\n\ni also patched WebdavServlet to default to an empty resource path prefix if one is not specified as a servlet init parameter.\n",
