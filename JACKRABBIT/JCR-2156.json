    "description": "Within jackrabbit the term \"qualified name\" is used, when the internal representation of a JCR name is referred according to the usage of \"fully-qualified name\" within the JSR 170 specification.\n\nBased on input by julian (Issue #449) the phrasing has been adjusted in JSR 283 to match the terminology used in XMLNS.\n\nAs of JSR 283\n\n- Qualified Name -> refers to a JCR Name in the form prefix:localname\n- Expanded Name -> is used for what was formerly called \"fully-qualified name\".\n\nIn order to avoid confusion i would suggest to fix the javadoc throughout the project and eventually add explanations in cases where method or class names are misleading.",
