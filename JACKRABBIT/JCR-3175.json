One needs to parse the value of the header from string to long. This issue affects InputContextImpl.getContentLength() in org.apache.jackrabbit.webdav.io from webdav/java (the current behavior is that the header is converted from string to int by the servlet API, then from int to long by Jackrabbit)\n\nTestcase: largefile from Litmus. (test 3 - large_put fails when the PUT request is received)",
