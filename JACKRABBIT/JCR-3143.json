    "description": "followup issue for JCR-3076.\n\nas jukka stated changing the jcr-server to serve the repository-descriptor without mandating a successful login would\nrequire quite some changes on the server side as the current flow demands a successful repository login in order\nto be access any resource including the root resource that acts as parent for all (available) workspaces. since the\nrepository-descriptor report has be requested one of the resources it also mandates a successful login although\nretrieving descriptors on the jcr-level is possible when just having the repository at hand.\n\non the other hand i would assume that the descriptor functionality present on the Repository is rarely used.\ntherefore i would suggest to just relax the check for supported options in the jcr2spi session implementation\nand skip the evaluation if the descriptor isn't available at all. consequently the failure of a non-supported\nfeature would be postponed to the point it reaches the SPI (instead of informing the API consumer upfront). \non the other hand supported operations would not fail just because the descriptors have not been loaded.",
