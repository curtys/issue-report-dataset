    "description": "the JsonDiffHandler#NodeHandler in the server part of the jcr remoting may only throw IOException\nif an error occurs. this results in unspecific BadRequest responses even if the problem source was\nsomething very specific such as e.g. a locked node.\n\nafter having a first glance at this i think that making DiffException a subclass of IOException would\nallow to generate much more specific responses codes that even include the original exception\ndetails.\n\ni will attach a patch as i didn't had time to carefully test it.  [the conformance tests passed].",
