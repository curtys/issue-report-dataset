            "body": "Changing the priority as it's possible for you to achieve the same functionality with extra client code.\n\nSession timeouts: I'm not convinced, as long as there's a reference to a Session instance it shouldn't just be closed without explicit action from the client. Once the reference is gone, the session should get closed as a part of the garbage collection process. I'm actually not sure whether this happens currently. If not, please file a new bug report for that.\n\nLock timeouts: Again, not convinced, since session-scoped locks will expire when the associated session is closed and open-scoped locks should by definition persist until they are explicitly unlocked. We perhaps should provide some administrative mechanism for retrieving the lock tokens of all active locks to avoid situations where the lock token of an open-scoped lock gets lost, but that would again be a different feature request.\n\nI'm inclined to resolve this issue as Won't Fix, but please counter my arguments if you think I'm wrong.",

With the stored  lock tokens a seperated batch job should be able to release the locks.  Not a beauty - but it should work.\n\nPerhaps someone has a better idea or can raise the priority of this task :)\n\nregards\n\n",

I think it's by far a better solution to this issue.\n",

Furthermore, it will be hard to implement in setups where many WebDAV server instances talk to the same JCR server (think HTTP-level load balancing).\n\nFurthermore, an existing document store may already support lock timeouts (very likely if it also supports WebDAV), in which case it would be *much* easier just to expose that through the JCR API.\n\n\n",

Even a standard node type like the following should be enough:\n\n    [ext:lockable] > mix:lockable mixin\n    - ext:timeout (DATE) ignore\n\nWe could add a process in Jackrabbit (or in an external client that has some way to retrieve the lock token of a node) that observes such ext:lockable nodes an unlocks them when the timeout has been reached. Refreshing the timeout would require just updating the ext:timeout property. (I'm not sure if there's a chance for some race conditions on locking/unlocking the node and setting the timeout property.)\n\nWould that cover the use case, or do we need some more internal mechanism?\n",
