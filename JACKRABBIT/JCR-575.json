This is because files created by JJTree (javacc) put filename and path in a comment of the generated files, like this:\n\n/*@bgen(jjtree) Generated By:JJTree: Do not edit this line. D:\\usr\\projects\\workspace\\jackrabbit\\target\\generated-src\\main\\org\\apache\\jackrabbit\\core\\query\\sql\\JCRSQL.jj */\n\nThe \\u in interpreted as an escape characted and so you get a \n\"BUILD FAILED ...
