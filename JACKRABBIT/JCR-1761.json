    "description": "Collection elements get mapped to a node \"collection-element\" when the mappings are specified through XML config files.  We need the ability to control this name through configuration.  Without that feature querying object structures is painful.  For example I have structure as below :\n\nclass Foo{\nString id;\n List<Foo> children\n List<Foo> friends\n}\n\nAnd I have a need to query a Foo with id : 100 .  If I am interested only in child nodes with id = 110 , I could specify through the Filter that look at only node names , \"childFoo\" ; If I have the flexibility of adding a child node name.",
