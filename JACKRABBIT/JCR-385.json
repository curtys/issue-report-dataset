An example query would be \"//element(*, nt:file) or //element(*, mix:lockable)\". It appears that in the invocation of the visit method the SimpleNode id indicates a type of JJTROOTDESCENDANTS at a certain point but the data is actually an OrQueryNode and hence the cast to a PathQueryNode fails.",
