            "body": "We found two distinct cases:\n- a parent referencing a child node that no longer exists\n- a node of which the parent is missing (these can show up in searches)\n\nIn the first case we just remove the reference to the child node. In the second case we delete the node and all of it's children. This could potentially be a bit dangerous, but in our case we found that these nodes are usually leftovers from delete actions. Another option could be, but that requires a bit more work, follow the unix analogy of a lost+found folder. So instead of removing them just make them children of a  \"special\" node.\n\nI have to admit that we have mostly been using 1.5 and with recent 1.5 versions we see almost no data corruption anymore. There have also been some bugs in our custom extensions with virtual layers which caused some of these problems in the past.\n\nWe always had great difficulty reproducing the data corruptions. Sometimes we found a way to reproduce one, but others times not at all. \n\n \n\n",
