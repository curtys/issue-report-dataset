            "body": "I have a solution tested extensively in our development environment, so I'm pretty sure it will work. The solution includes two new classes:\n\norg.apache.jackrabbit.core.persistence.bundle.PostgreSQLPersistenceManager\norg.apache.jackrabbit.core.persistence.bundle.util.PostgreSQLNameIndex\n\nAnd the new ddl file to generate the schema.\n\nThe work around to retrieve the generated key in postgres is implemented in PostgreSQLNameIndex. After doing the insert into <schemaObjectPrefix>NAMES table, the generated key is retrieved doing a second query on the implicit sequence that assigns values to the primary key column. It's very similar to the NGKDbNameIndex class in that same package, but the query is very specific to PostgreSQL and looks like this:\n\nselect currval(<schemaObjectPrefix>NAMES_ID_SEQ')\n\nThis is the link to the PostgreSQL documentation on the currval function: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/interactive/functions-sequence.html\n\nI have tested it with a PostgreSQL 7.4, 8.0 and 8.1. I am attaching these files here for you to test, modify and hopefully integrate in the SVN repositories. As written before, feel free to make any changes in these files.",

I don't have a PostgreSQL installation at hand right now, so I couldn't test that it actually works, but the code seems to do all the right things. Please test and reopen this issue if necessary.",

It has another index and the new 8.2 \"RETURNING\" feature, that allows to reduce the 2 statements going through the index to 1.\n\nThe two changes are a different schema and a different PostgreSQLNameIndex class. The PostgreSQLPersistenceManager class needs no changes.",
