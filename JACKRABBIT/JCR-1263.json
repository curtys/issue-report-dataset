    "description": "In line with isse JCR-417, I suggest to partially move the SimpleWebdavServlet from the jcr-webapp project to the jcr-server project. By partially I mean, that the new (moved) servlet will be abstract and the getRepository() method will be abstract. The jcr-webapp project will still contain a SimpleWebdavServlet (for backwards compatibility maintaing the same name) which just extends the new servlet and implements the getRepository() method using the RepositoryAccess servlet.\n\nThis allows for the reuse of the jcr-server project including the abstract SimpleWebdavServlet in other environments. My intention is to include this project (along with the webdav) project in Sling.\n\nWill provide a patch for this proposal\n\n(This issue is separated out of JCR-1262 as suggested by Angela)\n",
