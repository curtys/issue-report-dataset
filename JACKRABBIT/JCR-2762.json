            "body": "I started this by some refactoring and by adding test cases designed to ensure backwards compatibility of any improvements.\n\nThe attached 0001 patch is my first take at actually changing the serialization format. The patch introduces format version 3 that for now only changes the way JCR names are serialized. Instead of the index-based serialization that always used eight bytes for all names, I use a variable-length encoding that uses just a single byte for most of the standard names, and stores other names inline in the bundle itself. Standard namespaces (including the default namespace) only take three bits of storage. Typical non-standard names like \"content\" or \"author\" still end up taking about as much space as before.",

            "body": "I would rename the methods from readInt() / writeInt() to readVarInt() / writeVarInt(). The \"var\" stands for \"variable size\". Reason: this following code looks confusing until you understand readInt() doesn't do the same as in.readInt():\n\n+                    if (version >= BundleBinding.VERSION_3) {\n+                        len = readInt();\n+                    } else {\n+                        len = in.readInt();\n+                    }\n\nI would avoid recursion here (the same for writeInt):\n\n+    private int readInt() throws IOException {\n+        int b = in.readUnsignedByte();\n+        if ((b & 0x80) == 0) {\n+            return b;\n+        } else {\n+            return readInt() << 7 | b & 0x7f;\n+        }\n+    }\n\nMainly for performance (but also to avoid reading too much if the data is corrupt). Instead, I would use the J3 implementations at http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/sandbox/jackrabbit-j3/src/main/java/org/apache/jackrabbit/j3/mc/Bundle.java ",

            "body": "There's a few other optimizations I've been working on, most notably improved handling of date and long values, but patches 1-4 already achieve most of the potential size reductions. With these patches the size of typical bundles is down about 30-40% from before. The main benefits of the smaller bundle size are reduced disk usage and therefore faster I/O and more optimal use of disk caches.\n\nNote that all persistence managers necessarily have some storage overhead over the plain bundle size, so the total improvements will not be nearly as big as suggested by the bundle size reduction. For example, with these patches the size of the default workspace of a fresh installation of our proprietary CQ product drops from 154MB to 141MB (-9%). The time it took to fill the workspace (including writes to data store, etc.) went down from 85s to 72s (-16%), though this was just a single try so the performance numbers are fairly uncertain.\n\nI didn't yet commit these changes since changing the serialization format always carries some risk (though we now have a fairly good serialization test cases) and prevents switching back to an older version after an upgrade. The question therefore is, should we do this now for Jackrabbit 2.2 or postpone this for 2.3? I'm inclined to do this already in 2.2.",
