But support will probably be removed with the next version (0.16.4?) of the JCR spec.\n\nSVN revision: 160047",

    "description": "would be nice to be able to search specific properties like a fulltext search, e.g. with an ignore-case flag, so you could find a subset of the results of\n\n  select * from nt:base where contains('bla')\n\nusing something like\n\n  select * from nt:base where jcr:bla like '%bla%'\n\n(currently, the value must contain 'bla' exactly as it is to be found by the second query)\n\ni suggest to extend the contains function with an additional argument for the property to search in, e.g.\n\n  select * from nt:base where contains('bla',jcr:bla)\n\nthis could then also easily be used in XPath.\n",
