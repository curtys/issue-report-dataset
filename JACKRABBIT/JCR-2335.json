    "description": "I'm having problems with the jackrabbit-standalone component not starting up properly because of two issues:\n\n* The bundle packaging doesn't include the WEB-INF/config.xml file. I assume this is because of the more recent bundle plugin version treating whitespace differently in the inlining settings.\n\n* The RMI binding fails if a local RMI registry is already running with another repository reference. I'm thinking of simply disabling the RMI registry bindings and using the http://localhost:8080/rmi address as the recommended RMI endpoint.",
