            "body": "> do you mean lucene tokenizer ? \n\nyes.\n\nactually it's not that bad and only affects Jackrabbit versions 1.4 and lower. That's also the version where I discovered the issue. More recent versions use lucene-core 2.3.2 or 2.4.1, which only use one TokenStream at a time and even try to re-use the tokenizer.\n\nSee LUCENE-969.\n\nThere's still room for improvement. The JackrabbitAnalyzer does not implement reusableTokenStream(). That is, each value of a multi-valued property will instantiate a new Tokenizer.\n\nThe proposed patch fixes this. With the patch applied, the JCRAPITest suite takes about 10% less time to execute on my machine.",

    "description": "Multi-valued string properties are tokenized per value, which may consume quite some memory when there are lots of small values in on a property. The memory footprint is 2k per value, because each value is tokenized with a separate tokenizer instance. That tokenizer uses a stream buffer of 2k bytes.\n\nInstead the values should be concatenated (whitespace separated) and then tokenized in one go.",
