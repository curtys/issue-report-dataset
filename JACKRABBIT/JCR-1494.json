    "description": "XPathQueryBuilder returns an error string with the column offset where a parsing error occurred. Unfortunately this value is difficult to correlate to the users query string, as XPathQueryBuilder embellishes the query by doing\n\nstatement = \"for $v in \" + statement + \" return $v\";\n\nThis patch appends the modified statement to the query message so that the user can get the real position of the error.",
