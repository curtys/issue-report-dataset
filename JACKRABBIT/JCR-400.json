WARNING: PROPPATCH failed with 0 not 423\n     ...................... pass (with 1 warning)\n\nI think that warning is correct, as this is an error condition that doesn't need to be marshalled inside multistatus (1: it affects the resource at the Request URI and only that, 2: the operation failed completely). Let me also note that none of the other servers I tested with do return a 207 here (MS IIS, Apache/moddav, Xythos, SAP Netweaver KM),\n\nRFC2518bis will hopefully clarify error marshalling for PROPPATCH. \n\nFrom the source code, the current server behaviour is fully intentional (by specifically catching the DavException and using it in MultiStatus). Removing that code seems to fix the issue.\n",
