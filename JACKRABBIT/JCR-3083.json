The type of the value is still 'date', so any clients trying to access the value will still get an error.\n\nThis helps with repository level operations that need to be able to read bundles without actually using the values.\n\nSo just having old invalid 'date' properties in the repository will not interfere with operations any more.\nDealing with the errors that come from reading those specific dates is still to be handled by the client.",

    "description": "As noted in JCR-1996, it is possible for an old version of Jackrabbit to store date invalid date values in the repository. Currently such values cause exceptions when the repository attempts to read them. A better approach would be to automatically detect such dates and map them instead to string values to avoid losing any information. A client could then access the information as a string through the normal JCR API, and would only get a ValueFormatException when trying to read the value as a date, i.e. using the getDate() method.",
