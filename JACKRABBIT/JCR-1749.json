This mostly is of importance in the Util class providing access to the URL's data property. The other location of importance is the JCRURLConnection.connect() method, which loads the content length, content type and last modification time fields from the repository.\n\nFixed in Rev. 697778.",

When writing files with the Jackrabbit WebDAV server this is not the case as the jcr:content child node is of type nt:unstructured.\n\nAs a result the JCRUrlConnection.connect method fails with an ItemNotFoundException in the Util.getProperty(Item)  method because the primary item of the nt:unstructured node type is not defined.",
