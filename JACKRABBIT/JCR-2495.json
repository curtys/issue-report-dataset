    "description": "jcr2spi tests run with the spi2jcr module by default so they are configured to be skipped when jcr2spi is built. Manually running a jcr2spi test like this\n\nmvn -Dtest=MyTest -Dmaven.test.skip=false test\n\ndoes not work however. The pom configuration seems to take precedence here. \n\nTo fix this I propose to exclude all test instead of skipping them making it possible to manually execute tests like this\n\nmvn -Dtest=MyTest test\n",
