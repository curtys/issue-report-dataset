But conceptually, if one session has node and property set, before commit, the other session should not see it, or am I wrong? (my implemenation of access manager is using another session compared to the test code)\n\nstep to reproduce :\n1. copy the file to a directory \n2. copy required jar files to lib directory \n3. compile the code and run  JackrabbitTest \n\nLet me know how it goes.\n\nThanks.\n\nXiaohua \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
