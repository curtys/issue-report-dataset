However, these tests have been written in a way that also causes the incorrect reporting of reorder data in the info map.\n\nI wouldn't want to remove this completely, because then other aspects (ADDED/REMOVED events) wouldn't be tested anymore (once we mark the tests as failing in Jackrabbit). Instead, we could refactor the tests to check REMOVED and ADDED independently from MOVED.\n ",
