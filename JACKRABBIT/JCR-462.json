It slightly changes the default behaviour for JCA 1.0.\nOn startup it turns off the auto repository shutdown.\nOn close it shutdowns all the open repositories.\n\nIt shouldn't break the compatibility with JCA 1.0, if it does please reopen the issue.",

It causes redeployment to fail because sometimes the new RA is redeployed before the old one is garbage collected.\n\nImplementing the JCA 1.5 interface to manage the lifecycle would be useful.",
