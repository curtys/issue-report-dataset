    "description": "Both Session.importXML and Workspace.importXML don't work correctly in some cases.\n\nImporting very large foreign language (for example, Chinese) text property values could result in incorrect values on some platforms. The reason is, BufferedStringValue (buffers very large string to a temporary file) uses the platform default encoding to read and write the text.\n\nBufferedStringValue is relatively slow on some systems when importing large texts or binary data because of using FD().sync().\n\nIf an exported string value contains a carriage return (\\r), this character was truncated on some platforms.\n\nIf an exported string value contains a characters with code below 32 excluding newline (\\n) and tab (\\t) - for example form feed (\\f) - the imported string value was base64 encoded.\n",
