    "description": "Currently, reading from the DbDataStore creates a temporary file by default. If the application doesn't fully read or close the input stream, the file is not deleted. The best solution is to use finally { in.close() } in the application, but this is easily forgotten.\n\nI suggest to delete the temp file using finalize(). There is a small performance penalty when creating the temporary object, but compared to I/O it is very small. Note that FileInputStream and FileOutputStream also use finalize().",
