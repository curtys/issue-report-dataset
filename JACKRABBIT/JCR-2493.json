Currently this adds only about 3% to the time it takes to run the jackrabbit-core test suite, so I'm thinking of simply including it in the default test run, but if people prefer we can also put it in a separate integration test profile.",

    "description": "Currently we only test our persistence managers indirectly via JCR-level test cases. The downside of this approach is that we can only test one persistence manager implementation at a time, and need separate build profiles to switch from one implementation to another. To ensure better coverage and consistent behaviour across all our persistence managers I implemented a simple unit test that works directly against the PersistenceManager interface.",
