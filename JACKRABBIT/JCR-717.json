The jackrabbit-jca and jackrabbit-webapp projects do exactly this, they both depend on slf4j-log4j12, i.e. use log4j 1.2 for logging just as before.\n\nIn revision 511639 I also moved the second half of the JCR-683 commons-logging workaround from jackrabbit-webdav to jackrabbit-webapp. The commons-httpclient dependency of jackrabbit-webdav introduces a transitive compile-scope dependency to commons-logging, which was previously replaced by the jcl104-over-slf4j adapter library already in jackrabbit-webdav. The adapter workaround was moved to jackrabbit-webapp where we already do specify log4j as the selected logging framework. Thus other users of jackrabbit-webdav will either need to configure and use commons-logging, or to use a similar mechanism with the jcl104-over-slf4j adapter.",

It contains no functional improvements that we'd need, but is split to a separate slf4j-api library and a set of backend-specic logging adapters. This would allow us to avoid exposing log4j as a transitive dependency for projects that depend on Jackrabbit.",
