    "description": "QValues currently can not expose properties of types LONG and DOUBLE in a parsed format. Thus, setting/retrieving properties of these types requires roundtripping through Strings, which we should avoid.\n\nProposal:\n\n1) Add \"long getLong()\" and \"double getDouble()\" to QValue.\n\n2) Add matching create methods to QValueFactory.\n\n3) Take advantage of the new methods in JCR2SPI, for instance by allowing it's own Value implementation to internally just hold the QValue.\n\n",
