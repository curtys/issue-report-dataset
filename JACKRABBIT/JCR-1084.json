    "description": "When exporting to xml (system view, not tested with document view) the order of properties is not consistent.\nThis is not an issue with the jcr specification, since the order of properties is undefined, but keeping the same (whatever) order in xml export could be useful.\n\nAt this moment if you try running a few import->export->import->export roundtrips you will notice that the exported xml often changes. This is an example of the differences you can see:\n\n  <sv:property sv:name=\"jcr:uuid\" sv:type=\"String\">\n    <sv:value>59357999-b4fb-45cd-8111-59277caf14b7</sv:value>\n  </sv:property>\n+  <sv:property sv:name=\"title\" sv:type=\"String\">\n+    <sv:value>test</sv:value>\n+  </sv:property>\n  <sv:property sv:name=\"visible\" sv:type=\"String\">\n    <sv:value>true</sv:value>\n  </sv:property>\n-  <sv:property sv:name=\"title\" sv:type=\"String\">\n-    <sv:value>test</sv:value>\n-  </sv:property>\n\nIf you may need to diff between two exported files that could be pretty annoying, you have no clear way to understand if something has really changed or not.\nI would propose to keep ordering consistent between export: an easy way could be sorting properties alphabetically during export.\n\nThis behavior has been tested on a recent jackrabbit build from trunk (1.4-SNAPSHOT)\n\n\n\n",
