            "body": "the resourcebased access control model has been extended to allow a single \"glob\" restriction to be added for ACEs,\nwhich works according to the pattern defined by Node#getNodes(String[]) with the following special cases. any other restriction will be used to determine the exact match to the target path.\n\n- no restriction works as before: the ACE takes effect on the complete subtree as it used to be before.\n- an empty string restriction forces the ACE to take effect on the node it has been applied.\n\nknown limitations:\n\n- the pattern is a simple string value. it isn't namespace sensitive and makes no attempt to convert the any qualified name(fragments)\n  to internal name representations. a restriction \"*/my:property\" will be evaluated literally and will never match a my:property item\n  if the corresponding namespace uri gets remapped to some other prefix.\n\n- the current implementation has not yet been optimized... this will be covered by JCR-2573\n",
