    "description": "JSR 283 currently defines AccessControlManager#getEffectivePolicies(String nodePath) that would allow any Permission related UI to\ndisplay what policies contribute to a particular set of privileges. In addition the API defines AccessControlManager#getPrivileges(String nodePath) which\nreturns the privileges the editing session has at the specified path.\n\nIn order to have additional flexibility we started to add custom extensions (-> JackrabbitAccessControlManager) that allows e.g. to retrieve the privileges any set\nof principals has hat a specified path. I would like to extend this and in addition provide a method that allows to retrieve the effective policies for a set of principals.\nCurrently this can only be achieved by relying on a specific access control model and making assumptions about it's implementation, which obviously isn't\nthe desired effect.\nI",
