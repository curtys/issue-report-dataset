The jcr-commons implementation is a heavily refactored version of the previous functionality. The refactoring noticeably reduces the amount of code involved and increases the documentation of the relevant classes.\n\nI'll see if I could make also jcr2spi use the same functionality (note that I failed the last time I tried to do that).",

    "description": "As mentioned in JCR-1574, the current XML export functionality is generating workarounds like the new PropertyWrapper class. I'd like to refactor and clean up the XML export stuff so that such workarounds wouldn't be needed.\n\nAn additional bonus would be to make both core and jcr2spi use the same XML export mechanism. For example the one in core already supports JSR 283 shareable nodes, but the one in jcr2spi does not.",
