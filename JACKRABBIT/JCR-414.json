    "description": "During a transaction, if you create a new version then read the version history the \"jcr:successors\" property is not updated. Note that \"jcr:predecessors\" is updated properly.\n\nAlso, the version history is sometimes not propertly read. During the transaction, it might appear empty. This behavior in not consistent from one execution to another.\n\nAfter a restart of the repository, the version history and the \"jcr:successors\" property is read properly.\n\n* Tests cases will follow shortly.\n\nThanks, \n\nNicolas",
