    "description": "This only happens when a maxIdleTime is configured for the workspaces in the repository.xml and the workspace to index is not the default workspace.\n\nThe idle check considers a workspace as idle when there only a system session is open and the configured idle time elapsed. This is also the case when the workspace is initializing.\n\nThe repository should either check if a workspace is still initializing or we need to move the search manager initialization into the WorkspaceInfo.doInitialize() method.\n\n",
