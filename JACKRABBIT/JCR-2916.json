I replaced all the Field constructors with the proper ones to skip the intern() call.\n\nThe same issue seems to apply to org.apache.lucene.index.Term, it is also heavily used, and now provides a constructor that allows skipping the intern() call.\n\nDo you think that should be addressed in this issue too?",

The names are not one of the already interned constants.\n\nRegarding Term usage: I think we should create a separate issue for that.",
