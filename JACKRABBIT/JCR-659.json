The bug seems to be that for some reason, even if PropDef.isMultiple() is true for a given property, no ValueFormatException is thrown when setting the property as single value.\n\nWorkaround:\n\nIt works if I change PropInfo.apply() line 136 to \n\nif (va.length == 1 && !def.isMultiple()) {\n...\n\n",
