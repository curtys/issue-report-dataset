The JCR spec doesn't seem to indicate what should happen in such a case.\n\nThe problem isn't localized to a single session, as the namespace registrations are global and could thus mess with any number of active sessions that suddenly  receive a new namespace mapping in the underlying namespace registry. Thus I think the registration should not fail as the client code would have no way of anticipating such failures.\n\n+1 to automatically remapping the new namespace for sessions that have already mapped some other namespace to the same prefix.",
