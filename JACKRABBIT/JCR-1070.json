Also, see the existing READMEs and other meta files in the current release components as examples.",

Apart from \nthe promotion itself the discussion regarding distribution of common classes [2] and the related issue JCR-996 somehow depends on the promotion and i consider the latter one to be important to follow.\n\nSo far nobody objected the promotion. If this is still true, i will start working on that.\n\n\n\n\n[1] http://www.mail-archive.com/dev@jackrabbit.apache.org/msg06433.html\n[2] http://www.mail-archive.com/dev@jackrabbit.apache.org/msg06698.html",
