Note that we've recently moved resources to src/main/resources and also the BundleDbPersistenceManager class has seen some changes recently. Could you update the patch to match latest sources?",

Furthermore, I addressed Stefan's comment by creating a new method that constructs the SQL string and by overriding that method in the Oracle-specific subclasses. This also gives less code duplication.",
