Consider a big subtree of items (1 mio items, eg.), which you might want to delete. Just switching off integrity checks does not help here.",

As I wrote it will be not recommended to use it, it is only for experience JCR users which will be aware of any possible drawbacks.\n\nFrom other point of view using any relational database you can also temporarly disable constraint checking to speedup some bulk operations, then enable it again. And in some cases it is very helpfull.\n\n>references are a core feature of jsr-170 which imo must not be compromised through public api methods.\n\nI dot't need it exposed through public API. What I need is to have some methods which I can call on any component (could be RepositoryImpl, or WorkspaceImpl).\n\nFor now we have implemented this by extending SISM class and overriding some methods. But then our code is depenedent on Jackrabbit, and could stop work with newest versions.\n\n>Consider a big subtree of items (1 mio items, eg.), which you might want to delete. Just switching off integrity checks does not help here\n\nI think it helps, because you can remove tree in steps without worrying about references.\n\n>we should address the real issue instead.\n\nI really agree with you, but changing this could mean redesigning of jackrabbit core and it does not look that it could happen in the near future.\n\nStefan, Felix, could you recommend any other feasible solution for my use cases?",

    "description": "Some operations like clone, remove operating on huge subtree of nodes requires a lot of memory. To copy, clone, remove subtree all nodes are loaded into transient spaces. It allows such operations to be transactional, from other side it requires a lot of heap size and this memory size is directly dependent on the size of subtree (number of nodes). In result of this in some cases it is impossible to make such operations in one step. In our environment sometimes 1 GB of java heap is not enough to succesfully clone subtree  from one workspace to another.\n\nYou can always clone (copy, remove) tree in chunks, but if you have references between subtrees such approach fails. Possibilty of temporary disabling referential integrity checking for experienced JCR user could be very usefull then.\n\nAnother use case is to allow to clone selected subtrees of the whole structure between worskpaces. In our application we need to clone only some selected subtrees from one workspace to another. But we can not do that because of existing references. We need to clone the whol estructure first, then remove all unwanted nodes, which is really time expensive and memory consuming.\n",
