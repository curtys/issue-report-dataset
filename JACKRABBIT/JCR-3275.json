            "body": "Looks very good. I slightly changed where new data store items are logged. In your patch the BundleWriter logs a message when a node with a binary property is stored. This will also log when a node is updated, but the binary didn't change. I think this is confusing for a person looking at the log. Instead I moved the log statement to the class BLOBInDataStore. There the message will only be logged when a binary is actually added to the data store.\n\nComitted in revision: 1308743",

We wanted to make sure it's logged by default, so we have useful audit info by default without people having to change to debug level. Other audit logs are at debug as they are more chatty and we didn't want the whole system to be overwhelmed with so many logs.",

I think for audit logging to be useful, its basic form (i.e. ClusterNode part) needs to be logged at info level. Not many people want to enable debug logging which means no audit logging for majority of use cases and that defeats the purpose. So, I suggest we change ClusterNode audit logging back to info, so at least we have some audit log by default. I'd do it myself but I don't have commit rights :-)",

You are right audit log should be logged in basic form but i don't like to have different formats.\nAt the moment we have audit logs in ClusterNode, AbstractBundlePersistenceManager and BLOBInDataStore.\nTwo on debug level and one on info level. One looks like \"Stored {} to DataStore ({})\" and the other one in ClusterNode looks like \"[{}] {} {} ({})\" This is what i meant with speaking log ...\nWe should document what values are logged or not.\n\n",
