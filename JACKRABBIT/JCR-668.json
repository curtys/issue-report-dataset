Please open a new issue for any further improvements to avoid confusing the issue tracker.\n\nIn general it's OK to reopen \"Resolved\" issues if something comes up but if an issue is \"Closed\" then it would be better to file a new issue, as I've tried to \"freeze\" issues by closing them once the related fixes go out in a release. This \"freezing\" makes it easier to use the issue tracker to check the release  where a specific issue was fixed in.",
