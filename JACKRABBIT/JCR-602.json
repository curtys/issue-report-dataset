This shouldn't be a problem since the only recipient of the exceptions is the unit test framework  that doesn't really care about the type of the exception.\n\nI'm a bit worried about making direct changes to the TCK codebase, so could someone who's more involved with the TCK quickly review the patch before I commit it? I don't see any problems as the change should have no functional effects, I just want to make sure I don't accidentally mess with something important.",
