I noticed that you changed both FileJournal's and DatabaseJournal's revision.log to not sync after writing (opposed to the current state where they sync after every write), which might result in information loss if that cluster node crashes before the file system will eventually write changes back to disk. Don't you think this might be problematic?\n\nKind regards\nDominique",
