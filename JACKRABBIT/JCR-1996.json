In Jackrabbit the range is from 30 BC to 3189.\n\nI suggest we ignore values outside of the supported date range and log a warning. As a workaround one may use a long property where the full value range is supported.",

I noticed that retrieving the value through the JCR API will not work for the big dates (even when the repository is restarted):\n\nCaused by: javax.jcr.ValueFormatException: empty value\n        at org.apache.jackrabbit.value.DateValue.getDate(DateValue.java:139)\n\nIs this also solved by the patch?",

            "body": "> Is this also solved by the patch?\n\nno, it isn't. My test used a time that wasn't far enough in the future ;)\n\nThe problem is the five digit year. Bundle persistence managers store a date property as a string representation and on read parse the string using ISO8601.parse(String). This method returns null when there are five year digits.\n\nHmm, I'm not sure how this should be fixed. The specification says that a date is converted to String using ISO8601, but it doesn't say what should happen when the year cannot be represented with four digits. At the same time ValueFactory.createValue(Calendar) does not declare an exception, which makes it difficult to prevent such values. We might be able to throw an exception on setProperty() though. I'll have to check....",
