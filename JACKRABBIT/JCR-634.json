    "description": "I have implemented the log / trace mechanism for the JCR API. A short summary:\n\n- A wrapper for a Repository. All other objects that where created directly or indirectly (Session, Node and so on) are wrapped as well. \n- The wrappers log all JCR method calls to a file and call the underlying methods. \n- Return values and calling method / line number can be logged as well (optional). \n- The log file itself is mainly Java source code and can be compiled and run.\n- Included is a player to re-play log files (for example, if the log file is too big to be compiled).\n",
