The exception message is \"no matching child node definition found for {}Inbox\". I guess that's my ultimate problem, that my effective node type object has empty named and unnamed node definition arrays. But those values are coming straight from the in-memory transient repository, through my SPI bridge, so I don't see where the values could get dropped.\n\nNevertheless, if those arrays are empty (maybe due to a counterpart flaw in spi2jcr?), this flow still seems to be invalid, since an SPI can return anything, and it should not trigger a crash.",

I wrap my SPI in jcr2spi, so that's what I meant by the direct coupling of a JCR front-end being invoked by unit tests, a jcr back-end that's the in-mem store, and an SPI coupling inbetween.",

A configuration is loaded specifying in-memory persist manager\n    2. Config is wrapped in TransientRepository\n    3. that's wrapped in spi2jcr's RepositoryService using default BatchReadConfig\n    4. a jcr2spi provider is instantiated that directly couples to spi2jcr\n    5.
