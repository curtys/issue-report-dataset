    "description": "Several test cases assume that Lock.getLockToken has to return null for locks not attached to the current session. However, this is optional. Citing the Javadoc for getLockToken:\n\n     * May return the lock token for this lock. If this lock is open-scoped and\n     * the current session either holds the lock token for this lock, or the\n     * repository chooses to expose the lock token to the current session, then\n     * this method will return that lock token. Otherwise this method will\n     * return <code>null</code>.",
