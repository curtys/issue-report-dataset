    "description": "An error message is written to the log when the following sequence of operations is executed:\n\n- create node 'parent'\n- create node 'child' as a child of 'parent'\n- save\n- create node 'tmp'\n- move 'child' under 'tmp'\n- remove 'parent'\n- move 'tmp' to former path of 'parent'\n\nThe log will say: EventStateCollection: Unable to calculate old path of moved node\n\nThis is because the zombie path of 'child' is equal to the new path after the move. The EventStateCollection detects a new parentId assigned to 'child' and expects a new path that is different from the zombie path. The above case however shows that there is a use case where the paths are equal and events should be generated.",
