            "body": "Scott,\nThanks for sharing this!  I tried to get it running and ran into a few minor snags, so dove into it and created a updated version.  This should live in the jackrabbit sandbox, but doesn't seem to be there yet.  So, here's an updated version that works for the current jackrabbit 1.5-SNAPSHOT (as of today).\n\ncheers,\nJason\n\n\nHere's what changed:\n\nM      src/test/java/org/jcrutil/VfsTest.java\nM      src/main/java/org/jcrutil/JcrFileSystem.java\nM      src/main/java/org/jcrutil/JcrFileObject.java\nM      pom.xml\n\nUpdated VfsTest to close the filesystem when the test is in tearDown().  This allows the underlying Jackrabbit JCR to properly close the session.  If this isn't done, other VFS or Jackrabbit clients may not be able to use the same repository (as in: other tests using JCR).\n\nAdded close() method to the JcrFileSystem that closes the JCR session when the FileSystem is being closed.\n\nUpdated JcrFileObject doIsReadable() and doIsWriteable() to use the updated jackrabbit-core-1.5-SNAPSHOT PrivilegeRegistry class.  The PrivilegeRegistry had been refactored in the trunk, and caused the compile to fail.  Also fixed a IOException constructor that wraps and rethrows any problems from close().\n\nAdded <repositories> for jets3t and apache-snapshots to the pom.xml, and changedthe commons-vfs groupId and version to 1.0, so they can be found by others.\n",

    "description": "Attached are two utilities for Jackrabbit:\n\nThe first one is a DataStore implementation that uses Amazon S3 for storage.\nThis is fairly straightforward. It is configured by adding a DataStore\nsection to the repository.xml file, e.g.:\n   <DataStore class=\"org.jcrutil.S3DataStore\">\n       <param name=\"awsAccessKey\" value=\"\" />\n       <param name=\"awsSecretKey\" value=\"\" />\n       <param name=\"bucketName\" value=\"\" />\n       <param name=\"minModifiedDate\" value=\"0\" />\n       <param name=\"minRecordLength\" value=\"0\" />\n   </DataStore>\n\nThe second utility is a JCR based Commons VFS filesystem provider. This\nallows you to access a JCR repository (nt:file and nt:folder nodes) using\nthe Commons VFS API. I've also used this with MINA FTP Server and Dctm VFS\n(http://dctmvfs.sourceforge.net/) to provide FTP access to a Jackrabbit\nrepository.\n",
