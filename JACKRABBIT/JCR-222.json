So to get around this, I have modified the jackrabbit code RepositoryConfig.java:311 to read:\n \n               transformer.transform(\n                    //new DOMSource(template), new StreamResult(xml)); COMMENTED OUT! \n                    new DOMSource(template), new StreamResult(directory+\"\\\\\"+WORKSPACE_XML));\n\nA similar issue can be found here: http://forum.java.sun.com/thread.jspa?forumID=34&threadID=563077 and a somewhat similar issue can be found logged as a bug at sun: http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=5077403",
