    "description": "I'm tempted to work on implementing the WebDAV BIND protocol, as currently defined in http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-ietf-webdav-bind-20.html.\n\nThis issue can be used to collect design proposals and track progress.\n\n1) DAV:resource-id live property\n\nThis can be implemented in terms of the JCR UUID. However, we need to turn this one into a URI for WebDAV. If the JCR UUID happens to *really* use UUID syntax, we *could* use urn:uuid. Otherwise, it would probably useful to mint an HTTP URI, served by the WebDAV servlet. (note that the latter has the disadvantage that moving a node to a different server will affect its resource-id, in case that other server allows importing UUIDs).\n\n2) REBIND and UNBIND methods\n\nSame as MOVE and DELETE, with the excpetion of marshalling.\n\n3) DAV:parent-set property\n\nEither trivial (when node isn't shared), or needs to use the JCR 2.0 shared set functionality.\n\n4) BIND method\n\nEither trivial (when shareable nodes aren't supported), or needs to use the JCR 2.0 shared set functionality.\n\n5) Cycle detection in depth:infinity requests\n\nTBD :-)\n",
