            "body": "> what about SessionImpl.dump()?\n\nI dropped it because SessionImpl already had a toString() method and it seemed wrong to include too many internal details in the return value of a method that's directly accessible by JCR clients. We could instead print out the component details in SessionContext.toString(). I'll take a look at that.\n\n> i fail to see any benefit in removing this interface. what was your motivation?\n\nThe same functionality can be implemented in a more interoperable way using toString() methods. As an added bonus we even get rid of one extra internal abstraction.",

I'd like to drop the interface and refactor the dump() methods in various Jackrabbit classes to more detailed toString() methods that would be more useful to debuggers and other general-purpose diagnostic tools.",
