Subscription becomes a marker interface and allows an implementation to hold proprietary information about the current state of the subscription (e.g. an svn implementation may hold the revision number of the last change reported as events).\n\nUnless someone objects I will adapt all modules in jackrabbit accordingly and commit the changes later today.",
