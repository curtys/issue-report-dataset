I need some fix for this issue, because we can not go into production\nuntil this issue is fixed. We are in a Model 3 Deployment and our (Client)Applications have the WebDAVServlet\nwhich connects to a RMI Repository Server. If this Server now restart all client applications must restartet.\nHope for fix\nclaus",
