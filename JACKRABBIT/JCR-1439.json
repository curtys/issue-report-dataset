    "description": "Hi, I was trying MacOS X 10.5 Finder's WebDAV client to do testing on Jackrabbit 1.4 which is hosted on Tomcat 5.5.25 on a Windows XP SP2 computer on a LAN. I encounter an error while doing remote editing, I was able to open the text document, but the problem is I couldn't save it.\n\nI tried to find some log on Tomcat but sadly Jackrabbit didn't produces any log files regarding of my problem. So I used Ethereal 0.99.0 to check the packets from the Windows XP computer. The below trace is a summary from the exported text file of the packet analyzer where the problem occur:-\n\nline 11818:-\nNo.     Time        Source                Destination           Protocol Info\n4352 27.629257   10.60.1.90            10.60.1.187           HTTP     MOVE /jackrabbit-webapp-1.4/repository/default/.TemporaryItems/folders.501/TemporaryItems/(A%20Document%20Being%20Saved%20By%20TextEdit)/Copy%20of%20Request_for_GAMS_User_Account.rtf HTTP/1.1\n\nFrame 4352 (592 bytes on wire, 592 bytes captured)\nEthernet II, Src: AppleCom_72:c3:5e (00:0d:93:72:c3:5e), Dst: 00:19:d1:a0:34:f7 (00:19:d1:a0:34:f7)\nInternet Protocol, Src: 10.60.1.90 (10.60.1.90), Dst: 10.60.1.187 (10.60.1.187)\nTransmission Control Protocol, Src Port: 64970 (64970), Dst Port: 8080 (8080), Seq: 69060, Ack: 90475, Len: 526\n    Source port: 64970 (64970)\n    Destination port: 8080 (8080)\n    Sequence number: 69060    (relative sequence number)\n    Next sequence number: 69586    (relative sequence number)\n    Acknowledgement number: 90475    (relative ack number)\n    Header length: 32 bytes\n    Flags: 0x0018 (PSH, ACK)\n    Window size: 524280 (scaled)\n    Checksum: 0xd4f9 [correct]\n    Options: (12 bytes)\nHypertext Transfer Protocol\n    MOVE /jackrabbit-webapp-1.4/repository/default/.TemporaryItems/folders.501/TemporaryItems/(A%20Document%20Being%20Saved%20By%20TextEdit)/Copy%20of%20Request_for_GAMS_User_Account.rtf HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\n        Request Method: MOVE\n        Request URI: /jackrabbit-webapp-1.4/repository/default/.TemporaryItems/folders.501/TemporaryItems/(A%20Document%20Being%20Saved%20By%20TextEdit)/Copy%20of%20Request_for_GAMS_User_Account.rtf\n        Request Version: HTTP/1.1\n    User-Agent: WebDAVFS/1.5 (01508000) Darwin/9.1.0 (Power Macintosh)\\r\\n\n    Accept: */*\\r\\n\n    Destination: http://10.60.1.187:8080/jackrabbit-webapp-1.4/repository/default/au/gov/arc/www/rtf/Copy%20of%20Request_for_GAMS_User_Account.rtf\\r\\n\n    Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=\\r\\n\n        Credentials: admin:admin\n    Content-Length: 0\\r\\n\n    Connection: keep-alive\\r\\n\n    Host: 10.60.1.187:8080\\r\\n\n    \\r\\n\n\nline 11850 -\nNo.     Time        Source                Destination           Protocol Info\n4353 27.630345   10.60.1.187           10.60.1.90            HTTP     HTTP/1.1 412 Precondition Failed (text/html)\n\nFrame 4353 (1191 bytes on wire, 1191 bytes captured)\nEthernet II, Src: 00:19:d1:a0:34:f7 (00:19:d1:a0:34:f7), Dst: AppleCom_72:c3:5e (00:0d:93:72:c3:5e)\nInternet Protocol, Src: 10.60.1.187 (10.60.1.187), Dst: 10.60.1.90 (10.60.1.90)\nTransmission Control Protocol, Src Port: 8080 (8080), Dst Port: 64970 (64970), Seq: 90475, Ack: 69586, Len: 1125\n    Source port: 8080 (8080)\n    Destination port: 64970 (64970)\n    Sequence number: 90475    (relative sequence number)\n    Next sequence number: 91600    (relative sequence number)\n    Acknowledgement number: 69586    (relative ack number)\n    Header length: 32 bytes\n    Flags: 0x0018 (PSH, ACK)\n    Window size: 65535\n    Checksum: 0x1c18 [incorrect, should be 0xa2f0]\n    Options: (12 bytes)\nHypertext Transfer Protocol\n    HTTP/1.1 412 Precondition Failed\\r\\n\n        Request Version: HTTP/1.1\n        Response Code: 412\n    Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1\\r\\n\n    Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8\\r\\n\n    Content-Length: 965\\r\\n\n    Date: Fri, 29 Feb 2008 02:31:01 GMT\\r\\n\n    \\r\\n\nLine-based text data: text/html\n    <html><head><title>Apache Tomcat/5.5.25 - Error report</title><style><!--H1 {font-family:Tahoma,Arial,sans-serif;color:white;background-color:#525D76;font-size:22px;} H2 {font-family:Tahoma,Arial,sans-serif;color:white;background-color:#52\n",
