            "body": "i would like to suggest the following steps:\n\n1) consolidate the xml serialization (e.g. by defining a common interface).\n     currently this is not handled consistently throughout the dav-library.\n\n2) improve distinction between objects that are created on the client side\n    and read from the xml on the server and vice versa. currently the classes\n    focus on the server-side only.\n\ni think this would improve the classes and make it easier to  complete\nthe original task, that originates from jdom not being backwards compatible\nbetween the final release and 0,x-beta versions.\n\n3)  replace jdom.\n      i might be mistaken, but i got the impression that in contrast to jdom, \n      the standard w3c-dom is not very comfortable in terms of usage.\n      currently i'm thinking of rather using sax-events in order to write the xml\n      to the request/response body. this would also require that no exhaustive\n      dom-tree is created in advance (e.g. deep PROPFIND), but the multistatus\n      xml is built but when writing the response.\n\n",

            "body": "so far  the following steps are completed:\n\n- created a common interface for classes that must serialized as xml either on client or on the server side.\n   thus making the toXml method consistent.\n- modified the corresponding classes\n- removed JDOM dependency and replaced by w3c.DOM. in a first step i dropped the idea of using SAX events.\n- minor improvement regarding 2).\n\n\n\n",
