The jcr.jar has intentionally been omitted, because it is assumed that the TCK war is deployed in an environment that already contains the jcr.jar. If we would add it to the war file, the classses would be visible twice, which results in ClassCastExceptions in most application servers or servlet engines.\n\nRegarding the failing test cases: did you configure the TCK webapp, to tell it which repository to test?",
