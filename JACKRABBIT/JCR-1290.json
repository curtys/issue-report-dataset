I think we should switch to using Apache Tika (http://incubator.apache.org/tika/) instead of our custom text extractors.\n\nMeanwhile it would be nice to fix this, but without a more recent tm-extractors dependency or some effort in replacing the use of tm-extractors with direct POI calls there's not much we can do.\n\nSo, it would be great if someone wants to submit a patch for this improvement. Otherwise this will get fixed once we switch to Apache Tika.",
