            "body": "\"For simplicity I would rather use an instance of UUID instead of two longs. \"\n\nYes, that is easier\n\n\"hope that makes sense... ;)\"\n\nYes it totally does (goog explanation also), and I actually saw this exact behavior already  occuring in my test setups.  I was having a little misunderstanding about the fact that, logically though, parents can be found in a different index (segment) and this index might be recreated while the index holding the UUIDDocId to this parent. I also have noticed while working on JCR-1213 I found that it only worked when all indexes did not change, while it went wrong when I was having changing/merging indexes. Exactly the way you describe.  I am about to get all things sorted out regarding the combined index reader, which contains cachingmulti index readers, which contain in their turn lucene indexes. \n\nMight be an idea to picture this a little for documentation, or is there already something like it? \n\nI have only one thing I am still not yet sure about, which you might know from the top of your head: it is regarding JCR-1213 and this one:\n\nI have the idea that the CombinedIndexReader when doing a search in a workspace, normally contains 2 index reader: the one for workspace and a parent index (containing repository index info like node types isn't?), right? Now, I need to find out, wether when looking up a parent, if it is ever possible that a parent of a node can be found in the parent index (hope it is clear waht i mean?). I think it is not, and this might be quite important for me to implement JCR-1213, by caching regarding references to an index segment.\n",

Am thinking about a two step check, where first a reference to the entire MultiIndexReader  is checked. \n\nIF : check reference to the entire MultiIndexReader  instance is positive, return cached results.\nELSE IF :check the index reader segment instance the parent docnumber was in: if  instance present, recompute docNumber with respect to the new offsets in MultiIndexReader and return (almost) cached result.  \nELSE : recompute docNumber by search in MultiIndexReader  (the uncached case)\n\nI will try to implement it during the weekend because the next days I am really occupied. Will share my findings and tests (and performance issues) hopefully on sunday. ",

            "body": "\"For simplicity I would rather use an instance of UUID instead of two longs. \" \n\nBy the way I think the overhead of a UUID instance (12-16 bytes for an Object) seems to me redundant if only storing 2 longs is enough. My intention was to reduce memory consumption for the string uuid ( ~120 bytes) to two long's. Ofcourse, a UUID instance is still smaller than the original 120 bytes but still uses redundant memory (though I admit probably UUID instances are small enough :-) )\n\nThx for solving the issue! ",

    "description": "After JCR-1213 will be solved, lots of DocId.UUIDDocId can be cached, and not being cleaned after every gc(). The number of cached UUIDDocId can grow very large, depending on the size of the repository.  Therefor, instead of storing the private String uuid; we can make it more memory efficient by storing 2 long's, the lsb and msb of the uuid.  Storing 1.000.000 of parent UUIDDocId might differ about 100Mb of memory. \n\nI even did test by removing the entire uuid string, and not use msb or lsb, because, when everything works properly (with references to index reader segments (See JCR-1213)), the uuid is never needed again: in \n\nUUIDDocId getDocumentNumber(IndexReader reader) throws IOException {\n\nwe could set uuid = null just before the return. It works perfectly well, because when an index reader is recreated, the CachingIndexReader will be recreated, hence DocId[] parents will be recreated. \n\nSo, IMO, I think we might be able to remove the uuid entirely when the docNumber is found in DocId.UUIDDocId (obviously after JCR-1213)\n\nWDOT?\n\n",
