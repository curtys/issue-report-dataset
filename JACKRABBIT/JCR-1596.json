I tried to use Microsoft Vista folder and it correctly handles the uploading problem. It is not Jackrabbit WebDav's problem.\n\n   The only thing left is the search.jsp. I'm not sure this is the problem for Jackrabbit. It is probably more general problem for jsp or  web broswer(IE and FireFox): why is the parameter sent from the clients not encoded in utf-8 even the page is specifically a utf-8 page?\n\n  Anyway, this becomes a minor problem and can be worked around.\n\n\n ",

The file name I had is ''\u90ed\u53ef\u4e3a.txt'  and the uploaded command by the WebDav client did something like:\n\n  ========= Outbound Message =========\nPUT /op/%ED%EF%3A.txt HTTP/1.1\nHost: localhost:8080\n-----\n\n The server didn't decode it correctly -- the result is the file name got screwed and the file content was not uploaded.\n\n2. In the default web.war module,  there is search.jsp for rendering the search page. If I type Chinese text in the search box,  search.jsp does not decode the input parameter from ISO-8859-1 to utf-8 and in turn the search engine searches wrong string.\n\n3. The search engine does do search correctly if I hardcode the query  variable in search.jsp or do decoding the query parameter from ISO-885901 to utf-8.\n\n",
