Instead of handling the shared child node entries in NodeState the ChildNodeEntries itself now know about when the internal maps are shared.\n\nMost of the patch is simply renaming NodeState.ChildNodeEntry to ChildNodeEntry, so don't be shocked about the size of the patch ;)\n\nThe memory saving is now a bit lower but still significant. With this patch the ChildNodeEntries consume 14MB.\n\nI think a similar approach is possible with the property names map.",
