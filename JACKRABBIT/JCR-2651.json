Please run a consistency check on this workspace! ({}) has missing child '{}' ({})\n\nIn the code you are concatenating the arguments object array with a string:\n\n   log.error(\"Node {} ({}) has missing child '{}' ({})\", new Object[]{...} + \". Please run a consistency check on this workspace!\");\n\nso it results in replacing only the first argument.\n\nI guess, you intention was to do:\n\n   log.error(\"Node {} ({}) has missing child '{}' ({}). Please run a consistency check on this workspace!\", new Object[]{...});\n\ninstead.\n\nKind regards\nSergiy",
