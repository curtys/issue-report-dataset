That is, set the user.dir property in the setup method and reset it to its initial value in the teardown method. \n\nHowever I seem to be hitting http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do%3B:YfiG?bug_id=4117557 here. The files are being created at the wrong location. \n\nI therefor suggest to go with my initial proposal and set the working directory of the surefire plugin. \n\n",
