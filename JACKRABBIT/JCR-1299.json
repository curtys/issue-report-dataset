There are no text extractors configured, which makes the populate and search demos useless.\n\nProposed solution: create a new repository.xml in jackrabbit-webapp with text extractors configured.\n\nI know we should actually try to reduce the number of repository.xml files, but having one dedicated to jackrabbit-webapp seems reasonable, while we should try to achieve the same for the jackrabbit-core module.",
