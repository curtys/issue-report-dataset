            "body": "This is a pretty tricky issue.\n\nThe reason why Jackrabbit adds those extra xmlns attributes is that at least the default XML serializer in Sun Java 1.4 does not include xmlns settings in the serialized XML stream without those attributes (even if the correct startPrefixMapping() calls are made and the namespaces used in the exported elements). Unfortunately it seems like some serializers will add their own xmns attributes regardless of whether they already exist for an element, causing duplicate namespace declarations to occur.\n\nWe could (and should) use the new SerializingContentHandler class also for the XML export methods (curiously that seems to be the only XML serialization case where we *don't* yet use the new class) to automatically add the extra xmlns attributes only when they really are needed. This would solve the problem of duplicate xmlns attributes.\n\nHowever, many XML serializers that do output the needed xmlns attributes, only do so for namespaces that are actually referenced in the serialized elements. This is troublesome for JCR, where XML exports are always required to contain *all* registered namespaces even when the exported subtree doesn't reference them. I consider this a flaw in the JCR spec, but we still need to honor this requirement and make sure that all the xmlns attributes are included in the serialized output.\n\nI guess we need to extend the SerializingContentHnalder even more to detect the case when it needs to inject xmlns attributes only for unused namespaces.",

The export works fine with the built-in JAXP libraries in all JDKs we've tested, but it looks like other TransformerFactory implementations (like the one in the Xalan versions reported here) break the export.\n\nI'm still not sure how to best resolve this. I'm inclined to either revert back to the 1.4 code (with the potential of introducing other regressions) or going with a custom XML serializer that doesn't depend on any JAXP libraries (which would be a notable new block of potentially buggy code).",

The custom serializer and related classes were added in revision 746602 and in revision 746603 I modified the JCR XML exports to use this new serializer.\n\nNote that to keep things simple the new serializer is designed to only work with a fairly constrained stream of SAX events. This is OK for the XML exports we generate, but not necessarily for things like the DOM to SAX conversions used by the webdav component. Thus I've only modified the JCR XML exports to use the new serializer and kept other XML serializations based on the existing SerializingContentHandler class. \n\nMerged to the 1.5 branch in revision 746604.",

Most notably the events will consist of both startPrefixMapping calls for all namespaces *and* explicit xmlns attributes for those same namespaces. This behaviour is expected by the current TCK and is similar to what you'd get from a SAXParser with the http://xml.org/sax/features/namespace-prefixes feature enabled.\n\n* The above means that code that uses a ContentHandler instead of an OutputStream to capture the XML export will need to be aware of this.\n\n* On the other hand, the OutputStream exports are now guaranteed *not* to produce duplicate xmlns attributes regardless of what JAXP libraries are in the classpath.",
