Since none of the additional features of this class are used, and as I understand it Jackrabbit requires JDK 1.4+, this can be replaced with LinkedHashMap.\n\njcr-commons still brings in the commons-collections dependency, but I believe it can be safely excluded by users that don't need to use the predicates (Which is true of the webdav client)",
