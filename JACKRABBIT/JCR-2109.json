For this reason the corresponding classes haven't gone yet.\n\nHowever: \nThe *Format classes in jcr-commons are not up-to-date and do not respect the name/path extensions defined in JSR 283. This means that the Value implementations in jcr-commons are not compliant to JSR 283 and any implementation using them would fail to pass the TCK. My suggestion was to make the affected value implementations abstract or similar....\n\npreferences?\n\ni'll leave this issue open until we have that fixed.",
