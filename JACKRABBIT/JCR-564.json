Being of course a mandatory part of an application server, this jar has been included in the web application when used in servlet container environments, where it is optional. If you still need the \"geronimo-free\" web application, changing the value of the property \"war.bundle\" to \"false\" in your local copy should do the trick.",

The operations leaving that scope are the tests related to XA functionality: particularly o.a.j.core.UserTransactionImpl working as dummy javax.xa.UserTransaction, an interface that is not contained in the JRE's rt.jar. Therefore, I don't think, removing the dependency to geronimo-spec-jta is an option.",

The only required code changes are about copying a few private transaction status constants. In fact, looking at the code flow, the status codes are mostly unused, and could easily be replaced with two boolean flags (prepared & rolledBack). However, in order to keep this patch strictly non-functional, I didn't include such changes.\n\nI haven't yet looked at how this change affects downstream components like jackrabbit-jca.\n\n[1] http://www.nabble.com/Using-the-geronimo-jta-dependency-only-in-test-scope-tf4466162.html",
