            "body": "It's great to have a implementation-independent way to open a repository!\n\nThis implementation can't do a few things. The following use cases are unimportant for me, are they important for somebody else?:\n\n- An application can not get a list of installed providers. Workaround: use javax.imageio.spi.ServiceRegistry directly. \n\n- An application can not specify what provider to use (using RepositoryFactory): The repository factory calls connect on each provider, and returns the repository of the first provider that doesn't return null. Workaround: call the implementation directly.\n\n- An application can not find out what properties need to be set. I don't know of a workaround. It could be solved by adding RepositoryFactory.getParameterInfo similar to java.sql.Driver.getPropertyInfo.\n",
