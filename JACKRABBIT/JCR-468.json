            "body": "for the sake of correctness:\n\nthe quote in tobi's previous comment was extracted from a draft version of the next maintenance release of the spec (jcr 1.0.1) which has yet to be finalized.\n\nhere's what the current spec has to say about Item#isSame(Item):\n\n<quote_jcr_1_0>\nReturns true if this Item object (the Java object instance) represents the same actual repository item as the object otherItem.This method does not compare the states of the two items. For example, if two Item objects representing the same actual repository item have been retrieved through two different sessions and one has been modified, then this method will still return true when comparing these two objects. Note that if two Item objects representing the same repository item are retrieved through the same session they will always reflect the same state (see 7.1.3 Reflecting Item State) so comparing state is not an issue.A RepositoryException is thrown if an error occurs. \n</quote_jcr_1_0>\n\nthe current spec is obviously unclear about whether the workspace name has to be taken into account or not.\n\nas soon as jcr 1.0.1 has been finalized or we've reached consensus within the expert group about this topic\ni'll fix the the implementation in jackrabbit.\n\n",
