When initializing a repository during its startup, the create fails is you use a revision param like <param name=\"revision\" value=\"${rep.home}/repository/revision\" /> because the repository directory hasn't been created yet. Attached is a repository.xml that demonstrates. It uses Oracle for FS and PMs.",
