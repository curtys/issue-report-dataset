Unfortunately, I\nmissed that page.\n\nHowever, I came across this page right off:\n\nUser Guide -> Tutorial\nhttp://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/3.0/tutorial.html\n\n> The first thing you need to do is get a copy of HttpClient and it's\ndependencies. Currently the only required dependency is commons-logging.\n\nAnd yes, I know it says it's for 2.0, but obviously-misleading information\nshould be fixed, especially when filed under \"3.0/tutorial.html\"\n\nHaving a Dependencies section in the User Guide -- and it can be nothing more\nthan a link to the Dependencies page -- would make life easier for us end-users.\n",

Also because we\nuse Maven, dependency information on that page is always accurate and bug\nreports like this one should never occur.\n\nThanks for the pointer to the tutorial, however. We will sort this out ASAP.",
