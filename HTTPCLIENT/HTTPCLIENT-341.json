The \nattached patch should fix this one.\n\nThe only problem now is that HttpMethodBase.generateRequestLine() does not include the userinfo.\n\nMike",

A similar\npatch is however needed for HttpsURL as well. Note that I have removed duplicate\ncheckValid() calls and deprecated the constructors that take a userinfo as an\nargument, because you cannot determine from that whether a colon is within a\nusername or password or serves to separate these two components.",
