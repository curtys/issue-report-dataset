But now the URI class \nsolve all of them... \n\nIf there is the need to convert space to plus, perhaps that could be \nimplemented.  But that's not really URI specification... and for that kinda www-\nform-urlencoded, it's recommend for you use java.net.URLEncoder.\n\nBTW, I recommend you to use directly HttpURL or HttpsURL classes rather than \nURIUtil.  You will find the usefulness.\n",
