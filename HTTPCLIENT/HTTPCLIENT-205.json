I\nguess we should provide an additional constructor for the URI class. \n\nBesides, I find URI constructors a bit odd. Is there any particular reason why\nescaped uri should be passed as an array of chars, whereas unescaped uri should\nbe passed as strings, and not visa versa? It's too late to change anything about\nit. I just find it weird.\n\nOleg",
