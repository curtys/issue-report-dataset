            "body": "This is a small patch for improving some httpclient javadocs.  I didn't do everything, but focused mainly on the classes I knew, and classes which were lacking class-level javadocs.  Also included is a small change in the way the ClientPNames.CONNECTION_MANAGER_FACTORY parameter was used by DefaultHttpClient.  I renamed that parameter to CONNECTION_MANAGER_FACTORY_CLASS_NAME, since it's just the name of the class that is reflectively created, and replaced the old one with setting of the actual instance of a ClientConnectionManagerFactory.  This is important if the factory's constructor needed any dependencies it wanted to pass to instances of whatever ClientConnectionManager it wants to create.",
