    "description": "http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.2.3\n\n\"When comparing two URIs to decide if they match or not, a client SHOULD use a case-sensitive octet-by-octet comparison of the entire URIs, with these exceptions:\n  * A port that is empty or not given is equivalent to the default port for that URI-reference;\n  * Comparisons of host names MUST be case-insensitive;\n  * Comparisons of scheme names MUST be case-insensitive;\n  * An empty abs_path is equivalent to an abs_path of \"/\".\nCharacters other than those in the \"reserved\" and \"unsafe\" sets (see RFC 2396 [42]) are equivalent to their \"\"%\" HEX HEX\" encoding.\n\nFor example, the following three URIs are equivalent:\n      http://abc.com:80/~smith/home.html\n      http://ABC.com/%7Esmith/home.html\n      http://ABC.com:/%7esmith/home.html\"\n\nThe current implementation does not canonicalize the URIs it uses for cache keys, and so is missing potential cache hits. More importantly, though, required invalidations due to PUT/POST/DELETE to a URI (as well as those mentioned in Location or Content-Location headers) may not occur properly due to this bug.",
