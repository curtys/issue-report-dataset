The only\nproblem is that this patch changes the behaviour of EntityEnclosingMethod. \nThere is no longer a way to send a request with no content length and that isn't\nchunked.  Previously it was possible to do this by setting a content length less\nthat -2.  Doing this is generally not a good idea, but it was previously possible.\n\nMike",

I\nhad to revisit the spec while working on HttpClient 4.0. See RFC2616, section\n4.4 <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.4>, specifically:\n<quote>\n 5.By the server closing the connection. (Closing the connection cannot be used\nto indicate the end of a request body, since that would leave no possibility for\nthe server to send back a response.)\n</quote>\n\nOleg",

    "description": "Robert Manning <Robert.Manning at collabraspace.com> reported a problem on the\nhttpclient-user list regarding inconsistencies in javadoc of RequestEntity\ninterface and EntityEnclosingMethod class. This prompted me to review the said\nclasses. I have discovered several issues that must be dealt with before 3.0\ngoes final. \n\n(1) There's virtually no test coverage for the EntityEnclosingMethod class\n(2) The code in EntityEnclosingMethod class extensively uses deprecated methods\nand variables beyond what is required to maintain backward compatibility with\n2.0.x API\n(3) Existing code cannot gracefully handle faulty RequestEntity implementations\nif the getContentLength method returns a negative value < -2\n\nI have committed additional test cases to cover the most fundamental\nfunctionality of EntityEnclosingMethod:\nhttp://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jakarta/commons/proper/httpclient/trunk/src/test/org/apache/commons/httpclient/TestEntityEnclosingMethod.java\n\nI will submit a patch addressing issues (2) and (3) shortly\n\nOleg",
