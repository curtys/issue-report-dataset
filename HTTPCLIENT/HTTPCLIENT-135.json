    "description": "I am working with Cactus 1.4.1 on WebSphere NT and also WebSphere z/OS\n(mainframe). The problem seems to be with HTTPClient. I have tried with the\nnuild on the 7th December.\n\nI am trying to get basic cactus servlet tests working on WebSphere z/OS.\nEverything works fine through WebSphere NT, however, when the same application\nis deployed to WebSphere z/OS then we get the following error:\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?><?xml-stylesheet type=\"text/xsl\"\nhref=\"junit-noframes.xsl\"?><testsuites><testsuite name=\"TestCactusServlet\"\ntests=\"1\" failures=\"0\" errors=\"1\" time=\"10.184\"><testcase name=\"testNeal\"\ntime=\"10.182\"><error message=\"Error in parsing the status  line from the\nresponse: unable to find line starting with &quot;HTTP/&quot;\"\ntype=\"org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpRecoverableException\">org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpRecoverableException:\nError in parsing the status  line from the response: unable to find line\nstarting with &quot;HTTP/&quot;\n\tat\norg.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodBase.readStatusLine(HttpMethodBase.java:1791)\n\tat\norg.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodBase.readResponse(HttpMethodBase.java:1559)\n\tat\norg.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodBase.processRequest(HttpMethodBase.java:2219)\n\t... etc ...\n\nI have verified that the Application Server on WebSPhere z/OS is working fine. I\nset the logging on the cactus to DEBUG and noticed that the data that the\nHTTPClient is retrieving from the connection is scrambled in some way. For example:\n\n16:06:20,213 [WebSphere t=009d7920] DEBUG ent.HttpClientConnectionHelper  -\n>getCookieString = [null] \n16:06:20,317 [WebSphere t=009d7920] DEBUG httpclient.wire                 - >> \"\u00c7\u00c5\u00e3@a\u00e3?\u00a2\u00a3\u00c3?? etc...\n\nOn WebSphere NT the data at this point looks OK.\n\nWhat springs to mind is maybe ascii/ebcdic conversion problem. z/OS uses unicode\n for java, as it should. However, the HTTPClient creates it own socket\nconnection to the app server and therefore it is connecting to non java code. In\nsuch a situation codepage conversion is necessary.\n\nCould anybody adsvise on how to get this to work?\n\nRegards,\n\nNeal Johnston-Ward",
