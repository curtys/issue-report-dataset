I just saw you resolved the issue.\n\nI tested the scenario with 4.0 and i dont see the problem. \nBut I just want to prove that its a bug in 3.x version as I am not in a position to upgrade to 4.0 as its a beta. \nWhat information/logs do you need. I have a test case which will reproduce this behavior.\n\nThanks\nPraveen",
