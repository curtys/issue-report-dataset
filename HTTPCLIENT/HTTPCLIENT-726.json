I've implemented a testcase, and the Clover counts indicated that I even caught one real spurious wakeup in addition to the simulated ones :-)\n\nFor the curious: in ConnPoolByRoute.getEntry(...) is the following code block:\n\nif (waitingThread == null) {\n    waitingThread =\n        newWaitingThread(poolLock.newCondition(), rospl);\n}\n\nThe condition is 'false' only if a spurious wakeup is being handled. The testcase generates three simulated ones. If the count indicates that the block has been skipped more often, you know that a real spurious wakeup has occurred.\n\ncheers,\n  Roland\n",
