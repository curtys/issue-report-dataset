I would only make StringRequestEntity a little more\nintelligent with regards to charset attribute of the content type.\n\nFor instance, new StringRequestEntity(\"stuff\", \"text/plain; charset=UTF-8\")\nshould be smart enough to extract the charset attribute from the content type.\nLikewise new StringRequestEntity(\"stuff\", \"text/plain\", \"UTF-8\") should be able\nto add the charset attribute to the content type.\n\nDo not worry about missing test cases at this point. I suspect the rest of the\n3.0 development will be all about improving HttpClient's test coverage\n\nOleg",
