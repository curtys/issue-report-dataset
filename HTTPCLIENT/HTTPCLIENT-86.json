    "description": "The Cookie class doesn't have a default (no argument) constructor. This is \ncausing problem for some framework which supports marshalling and unmarshalling \nof data types. e.g. a SOAP implementation may need to do this to transfer it \nbetween the SOAP server and SOAP client. It would be nice to add a default \nconstructor, as it won't break anything, follows JavaBean convention, and \npotentially save user some trouble in the future.",
