It's going to conflict slightly with the patch from HTTPCLIENT-734, because both are adding the new file 'TestDefaultClientRequestDirector' -- but the merge conflict is easily resolved.\n\n(Previously the connection would only be released during the next garbage collection [which might never happen], and could prevent subsequent requests from being tried if they were waiting on an available slot.)",
