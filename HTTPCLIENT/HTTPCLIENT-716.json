            "body": "Hi Oleg,\n\nI've added several parameters for the route planner. It is now possible to specify the local address.\nIt's also possible to specify a forced route either as parameter or context attribute. The forced route basically disables route planning. An application would set a forced route as a parameter. The context attribute is for retry handlers that may choose a different route for the retry. Since we don't want the framework to modify parameters, this has to go into the context.\n\nI'm leaving this issue open until you've reviewed the changes.\n\ncheers,\n  Roland\n ",

I know it is too early to start thinking about performance optimizations, but nonetheless performance is an important factor we ought not neglect. Could we eliminate context lookup? This will also make the logic somewhat simpler.\n\nOleg  ",
