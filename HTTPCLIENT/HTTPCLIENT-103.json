    "description": "ChunkedInputStream does not correctly read the chunk size when a semicolon does\nnot appear in the first line of the chunk.  If whitespace exists between the\nchunk size value and the end of line and no semicolon is present, the whitespace\nis not removed before parseInt is called resulting in an IOException \"Bad chunk\nsize\"\n\nI can not tell from RFC2616 if whitespace is legal here, but I have received it\nfrom at least one web server.  The relevant section is 3.6.1.\n\nA small patch repairs the problem.  I will attach it immediately.",
