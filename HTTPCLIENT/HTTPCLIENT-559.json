It cannot use Java 1.4\nspecific interfaces. One of the reasons why all these classes are in the contrib\npackage is that they ought not to be used without customization. This is also a\nreason why we do not distribute the contrib code in a form of a jar package\n\nOleg",

Please correct me if I am wrong, but\njavax.net.ssl.X509TrustManager class, for instance, is not available in the JSSE\n1.0.3 \n\nhttp://java.sun.com/products/jsse/doc/apidoc/index.html\n\nOleg",
