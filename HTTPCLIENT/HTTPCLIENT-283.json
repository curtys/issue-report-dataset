The Cookie constructor can still be called outside of the \ncontext of the CookieSpecBase.parse() and should still do error checking I think.\n\nMike",

I would much rather prefer Cookie \nconstructors to throw MalformedCookieException, but we cannot change API at \nthis point.\n\nI'll rework the patch in a minute.\n\nOleg",

The policy I have adopted for years after reading\nan article about the problem is:\n\n- unchecked if the caller could have avoided the problem by using the\n  class/method/object correctly, e.g. by passing valid arguments,\n  performing necessary initializations, and so on\n- unchecked if the problem is outside of the callers control, such\n  as network connectivity, file system errors, and so on\n\nBased on this policy, throwing a RuntimeException for bad parameters\nis appropriate.\n",

In some cases the Cookie values contain \",\" characters, which  \nreally confuses the Header/Cookie parsers and eventually leads to  \nIllegalArgumentExceptions thrown by the Cookie constructor:\n\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cookie name may not be blank\n   at org.apache.commons.httpclient.Cookie.<init>(Cookie.java:142)\n   at  \norg.apache.commons.httpclient.cookie.CookieSpecBase.parse(CookieSpecBase \n.java:192)\n   at  \norg.apache.commons.httpclient.cookie.CookieSpecBase.parse(CookieSpecBase \n.java:256)\n   at  \norg.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodBase.processResponseHeaders(Http \nMethodBase.java:1826)\n   at  \norg.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodBase.readResponse(HttpMethodBase \n.java:1939)\n   at  \norg.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodBase.processRequest(HttpMethodBa \nse.java:2631)\n   at  \norg.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodBase.execute(HttpMethodBase.java \n:1085)\n   at  \norg.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpClient.executeMethod(HttpClient.java:6 \n74)\n   at  \norg.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpClient.executeMethod(HttpClient.java:5 \n29)\n   at my.code.Test.getHttp(Test.java:114)\n\nWhat bothers me, is that these IllegalArgumentExceptions are never  \ncaught in the HttpClient code, making it effectivily impossible to  \nhandle these responses.\n\n</quote>",
