I'll submit a better version once I can confirm it runs correctly against the latest SVN version and test cases.\n\nOleg,\nI initially tried both the HttpMethod#abort and releaseConnection methods but both end up calling close on the response input stream, and if this input stream is the ContentLengthInputStream it will block until the whole response is read. \n\nI suppose the releaseConnection method could be changed to perform differently in the case where the ContentLength wrapper is used, but it seems easier not to add this wrapper in the first place rather than working around it later on. The advantage of leaving the input stream unwrapped in the Connection:close case is that methods like abort and releaseConnection then close down the stream immediately without any further changes. \n\nThe proposed changes act much like the existing code for the case when the response length is unknown. However, I don't have a good understanding of how this approach might affect other aspects of the client so there could well be problems I don't appreciate...\n",

See for yourself:\nhttp://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/xref/org/apache/commons/httpclient/HttpMethodBase.html#1008\n\n> I suppose the releaseConnection method could be changed to perform differently in the case where the ContentLength wrapper is used, but it seems easier not to add this wrapper in the first place rather than working around it later on\n\nIt's been a conscious design decision on our part that the consumer of HttpClient must not be able to close the underlying socket stream directly and I personally want to keep it this way. \n\nBesides, this problem has nothing to do with the content-length delimited content streams. The problem equally affects chunk-encoded content streams. If the server responds with 'connection: close' there's no point in reading the stream to the end of stream regardless whether it is content-length delimited or chunk encoded. I hope this will point you in the right direction.\n\nOleg",

The abort method was specifically designed for the purpose to let the user cancel a download.\n\nOleg,\nIn my opinion the patch is a correct optimization of the releaseConnection() method. It passes all current tests and I am confident that it does not break anything. To be sure we need some feedback from users with more complex setups like NTLM proxies. Those are the corner cases where changes like this one might cause problems.\n\nOdi",

Even though it does prove useful in some corner cases, it actually negatively impacts performance in the most common use cases (when the response content has been fully consumed or the connection can be kept alive). The invocation of the HttpMethodBase#shouldCloseConnection method is far from being cheap. With this patch the method gets called twice for every response in the overwhelming number of cases. I suggest this issue be marked as WONTFIX or be dealt with in the 4.0 version.\n\nOleg",

There are probably plenty of places in 3.0 that do with some optimization, but that has not really been the focus for 3.0 to date.  The added benefit of this change outweights the minor performance hit in my book.  Roland?\n\nMike",

    "description": "I am working on a HttpClient-based application to send and receive potentially large files (up to Gigabytes). When receiving large files the application allows the user to cancel the download, at which time it closes the response input stream behind the scenes.\n\nThe input stream currently provided by HttpMethodBase.getResponseBody() for un-chunked responses with a known content length is a ContentLengthInputStream, which automatically reads the remainder of the wrapped response instead of closing it straight away. This behaviour does not work well with very large files as the data is downloaded unnecessarily and the connection is held open for long very periods.\n\nPer the HTTP 1.1 spec section 14.10 it seems to me that either a server or a client in an HTTP 1.1 connection can use the Connection:close directive to signal that a connection will be non-persistent, and will therefore not require that all data be read before the connection can be released (the cleaning up ContentLengthInputStream performs for persistent connections).\n\nhttp://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.10\n\nCould HttpMethodBase be modified to check for this directive, from the server or client, and avoid wrapping the response input stream in ContentLengthInputStream when it is present? It seems straight-forward, though there may be side-effects I am not aware of. \n",
