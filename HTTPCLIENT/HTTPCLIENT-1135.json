It seems that Sun/Oracle/OpenJDK's don't document it, but supports \"w\" mode that is equivalent to \"rw\" Android does as the Javadocs say, and throws an IllegalArgumentException when mode \"w\" is passed as HttpClientCache does IOUtils.copyFile() (line 70-71).\n\nThis means that HttpClient Cache does not work on Android.",
