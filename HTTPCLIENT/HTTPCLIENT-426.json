    "description": "It was determined that when sending post data to server via Squid proxy server\nof version 2.4.STABLE2 and Squid responds \nwith \"407 proxy authentication required\" response, httpclient doesn't read this\nresponse in order to parse, but rather\nfails with soket exception \"java.net.SocketException: Software caused connection\nabort: recv failed\".\n\nThis behaviour is reproduced with the latest nigtly build of httpclient version\n3.0. (from 9 of February 2005) as\nwell as 3.0. RC1, 2.0.2 and 2.0.\n\nThis is the piece of code that sends post data using httpclient:\n\ntry\n{\n\tHttpClientParams httpClientParams = new HttpClientParams();\n\tHttpClient client = new HttpClient(httpClientParams);\n\n\tHostConfiguration hostconfig = new HostConfiguration();\n\thostconfig.setProxy(\"db00-devl.eps.agfa.be\", 3128); // SQUID proxy server\nversion 2.4.STABLE2\n\tclient.setHostConfiguration(hostconfig);\n\tPostMethod postMethod = new\nPostMethod(\"http://brugge.eps.agfa.be/portal03/servlet/selectFiles\");\n\n\tpostMethod.addParameter(\"data\", \"some data\");\n\tint status = client.executeMethod(postMethod);\n\tSystem.out.println(\"status = \" + status);\n\tif (status == HttpStatus.SC_OK)\n\t\tSystem.out.println(\"Ok\");\n\telse if (status == HttpStatus.SC_PROXY_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED)\n\t\tSystem.out.println(\"Proxy authentication required.\");\n}\ncatch (Exception e)\n{\n\tSystem.out.println(\"Socket exception.\");\n\te.printStackTrace();\n}\n\nLook at \"debug log of the problem\" attachment to see all output from httpclient\nand mentioned piece of code.\nIn \"problem_request_response_interaction\" attacment it is possible to see\ninteraction beetween httpclient and Squid proxy server: httpclient sends initial\nrequest and headers, then squid responds with \"proxy authentication required\"\nresponse and afterwards httpclient tries to send post data(without reading the\nresponse) but fails because connection is already closed.\n\nFor more details look at \"ethereal_problem\" attachment for all network traffic\nduring running of mentioned piece of code:\nEthereal protocol analyzer can be used to open this file(http://www.ethereal.com/).\n\nMost likely this particular version of Squid closes connection after it sends\nproxy athentication response back,\nwhich causes httpclient to fail while sending post data.\n\nLet's have a look at what writeRequest(...) method of HttpMethodBase class does:\n\n1) sends request line and headers to server,\n2) handles 'Expect: 100-continue' handshake if needed,\n3) sends post data to server.\n\nMy question is should HTTPClient send initial request and headers before data\neven if it is not going to read \na response from the server(proxy server), or this should be done only in case of\n'Expect: 100-continue' handshake \n(this seems the only case when HTTPClient is going to listen to server\nin-between of steps 1 and 3)?\n\nMy understanding is that the command\n\n        // make sure the status line and headers have been sent\n        conn.flushRequestOutputStream();\n        \nwhich actually splits sending of data in two parts are needed only for 'Expect:\n100-continue' handshake case.\nJust by moving \"flush\" command to appropriate place inside 'Expect:\n100-continue' handshake case:\n\t\t.....\n                try {\n\t            conn.flushRequestOutputStream(); // moved\n                    conn.setSocketTimeout(RESPONSE_WAIT_TIME_MS);\n\t\t.....\nit is posible to solve described problem.\n\nI created PostMethodEx that overrides writeRequest(...) method of\nHttpMethodBase(look at \"PostMethodEx\" attachment) \nand for all cases but the 'Expect: 100-continue' handshake it sends request\nline, headers and post data to server \nat once.\n\nWhen mentioned piece of code(with PostMethod changed to PostMethodEx) is\nexecuted everyting works fine:\nlook at \"debug log of the fix\", \"fix_request_response_interaction\" and\n\"ethereal_fix\"(all network trafic) \nattachments.\n\nAccording to mentioned logs httpclient sends all post data at once and then\nreads and parses \"proxy authentication required\" \nresponse from squid and sets status code to 407.
