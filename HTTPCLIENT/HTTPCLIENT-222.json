    "description": "Hi there,\n\nThis morning I downloaded beta 1 and tried a small piece of code to connect to \na SSLified apache server (using basic authentication) via a MS-Proxy 2.0 with \nNTLM enabled. The sourcecode of my crashme is based on the 1st attachment for \nHTTPCLIENT-153. It differs from the original in using basic authentication for the \nwebserver instead of NTLM.\n\nIt failed with this error:\n\n--\n10-jun-2003 16:39:05 org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodBase \nprocessAuthenticationResponse\nINFO: Already tried to authenticate to \"website#\" but still receiving 407.\nStatus: 407 : Proxy authentication required\n--\n\nThen I downloaded a fresh night build (commons-httpclient-20030605) which also \nfailed :/\n\nThen I went back to an old build from May (commons-httpclient-20030522) which \nworked like a charm!!!\n\nUsing MSIE I can succesfully connect to the apache server. I know it's not a \nproblem with typos because I have MSIE ask me for all creds.\n\nSeems somethings got broken along the way. If I can help, please ask!\n\nCheers.",
