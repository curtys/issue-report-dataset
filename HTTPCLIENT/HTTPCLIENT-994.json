I even fixed another bug while I was at it.\n\nThe refactoring includes:\n* Removal of the CacheValidityPolicy and associated unit test; almost all of this functionality was moved to the HttpCacheEntry; created a new TestHttpCacheEntry unit test.\n* Removal of the CacheEntry test class; instead added some convenience methods to HttpTestUtils to allow for easily manufacturing proper HttpCacheEntry instances instead.\n\nThe bug fix was a minor one related to the requirement that a cache cannot respond with a cache entry to a request with multiple conditional headers where not all of them match; it turned out the test case for this was incorrect (it was using If-Unmodified-Since instead of If-Modified-Since in the test) and hence the bug wasn't immediately obvious.\n\nThis patch is contributed to the ASF with the permission of my employer.",

Presently HttpCacheEntry is just a simple bean class that carries state information about a cache entry. One can apply different strategies to determine whether or not the entry is fresh. What do we have to gain by mixing state and protocol logic in one class?\n\nOleg",

            "body": "Hi Oleg,\n\nGood question. Currently the CachedResponseSuitabilityChecker is where we decide whether a specific cache entry can be used to satisfy a given request. This is the class that could be replaced or extended to provide alternative (but allowed) caching policies, like heuristic caching, for example.  \n\nPlease take a look, but I am pretty certain that all the methods on HttpCacheEntry now are either calculations whose definitions are given in the RFC (apparent age, freshness lifetime, whether it can be revalidated, etc.) or related to MUST-level requirements (treating malformed Expires headers as 'already stale'). \n\nAlso, CacheValidityPolicy, where all these methods used to live, had almost no interesting state, and all it's methods took an HttpCacheEntry as an argument; it seemed pretty clear these two classes \"wanted\" to be merged. :)\n\nJon",

            "body": "I can understand keeping state and protocol processing decoupled, which is why we have a CachedResponseSuitabilityChecker instead of just saying HttpCacheEntry#canYouBeUsedToSatisfy(HttpRequest req). In this case, the methods that got moved to HttpCacheEntry are all essentially properties of a cache entry; just as a Header can find its HeaderElements for you, now an HttpCacheEntry can tell you its apparent age (a *defined* property in the RFC). Whether the caching module actually decides to use the cache entry to satisfy a request is outside of the scope of the HttpCacheEntry.\n\nGenerally, I think the main advantage here is a simplification of the implementation: one fewer class to maintain or understand. In particular, an HttpCacheEntry is a domain object, whereas a CacheValidityPolicy is a construct of the implementation. In this case, there is little future flexibility lost here, since all the calculations are explicitly defined by the RFC, and we still have a place to make implementation-specific behavioral changes (CachedResponseSuitabilityChecker); we don't need two such places.\n\nFinally, I think the CacheValidityPolicy and HttpCacheEntry as they exist in trunk now exhibit a few OO \"code smells\", namely that they are two separate classes that are tightly coupled; there isn't anything you can do with a CacheValidityPolicy without also having an HttpCacheEntry instance. Also, the CacheValidityPolicy's state is pretty much just a single boolean; there's not much state there, just code, which suggests that the code probably wants to be moved towards the state it operates on (HttpCacheEntry).\n\nBut generally speaking, I think this is as simple as \"why have two classes when one will do\"?\n\n",

RFCs do get superseded with updated versions. You never know what might happen in the future. If HttpCacheEntry API proves inflexible to meet new requirements, pretty much the entire caching API will have to be deprecated. \n\n> Finally, I think the CacheValidityPolicy and HttpCacheEntry as they exist in trunk now exhibit a few OO \"code smells\", \n> namely that they are two separate classes that are tightly coupled.\n\nI am not sure I agree. HttpCacheEntry has no dependency on CacheValidityPolicy of what so ever.\n\n> But generally speaking, I think this is as simple as \"why have two classes when one will do\"? \n\nBecause you never know what might happen in the future. I have been maintaining HttpClient for looooong 7 years and I have had numerous moments when I wished some bits of code had never been made a part of public API.\n\nIf you remain unconvinced I'll commit the patch within a few days.\n\nOleg",
