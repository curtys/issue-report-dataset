If something like the HostConfiguration class w/o target host is needed, it can be re-introduced with the same or a better name.\n",

This will allow one HostConfiguration object to be used for different targets.\nThe problem is that currently MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager uses HostConfiguration objects as cache keys, which needs to be changed.\n\nThis is a followup to HTTPCLIENT-615.\n\ncheers,\n  Roland\n",
