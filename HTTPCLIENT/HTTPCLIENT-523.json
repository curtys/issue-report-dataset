Please review / double-check\n\nhttp://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=814311\n\nA few notes:\n\n(1) I copied content of krb5.conf and login.conf files to the ClientKerberosAuthentication sample to make it self-contained. Ideally the example should have a little more documentation in the javadocs. Please consider putting some more work into it.\n\n(2) We cannot have dependencies on external libraries such as BouncyCastle JCE implementation in examples. Ideally sample files should be functional with the standard set of dependencies. Worst case I would rather have that example require Java 1.6 to run as long as it complies with Java 1.5 and the runtime dependency on 1.6 is clearly documented in the javadocs\n\n(3) I moved BouncySpnegoTokenGenerator class to the contrib (unsupported) area for the reason given above:\nhttp://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpcomponents/httpclient/trunk/contrib/org/apache/http/contrib/auth/BouncySpnegoTokenGenerator.java \n\nMany thanks for this contribution.
