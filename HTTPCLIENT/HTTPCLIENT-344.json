The logs will then indicate that the connection was stale, even though it was really just closed.  \nclose() is also called a second time unnecessarily.\n\nThis should be fixed for 3.0, and perhaps even 2.0.1.\n\n<http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=commons-httpclient-\ndev@jakarta.apache.org&msgNo=7205>",
