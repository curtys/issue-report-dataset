HttpMultiClient was\nadded in 2.0alpha1 to address the lack of synchronization in the old client and\nprovide the core for a multi-threaded http based application.\n\nThe problem is that we have 2 different client classes that although they do\npretty much the same thing, their interfaces are quite different due to the\nsingle session nature of HttpClient and the multiple connection pool\nHttpMultiClient.\n\nHere are 4 proposed requirements for this feature.\n1) The top level class should be HttpClient\n2) HttpMultiClient has the functionality we should present in the top level\nclass\n3) HttpMultiClient has not been in a release other than alpha, so it should be\nsafe to remove as an interface\n4) Backwards compatability with HttpClient1.0 interface should be maintained as\nmuch as possible, with deprication where it makes sense.\n",
