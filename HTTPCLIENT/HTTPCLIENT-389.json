    "description": "Hello,\n\nIt would be really nice to have util methods that help with setting date\nheaders.  For instance, like the servlet spec's setDateHeader() method.  This\nallows for the client of HttpClient to not have to deal with formatting the date\ninto the correct string.  There is a parseDate method that turns a String into a\nDate.  It would be nice to have the opposite method.\n\nThanks!\nSeth",
