            "body": "Hi Adam,\n\nThank you for posting this bug.  I tried this out and was unfortunately unable to reproduce the \nproblem.  Here's what I tried:\n\n        System.setProperty(\"org.apache.commons.logging.Log\", \n\"org.apache.commons.logging.impl.SimpleLog\"); \n        System.setProperty(\"org.apache.commons.logging.simplelog.showdatetime\", \"true\"); \n        System.setProperty(\"org.apache.commons.logging.simplelog.log.httpclient.wire\", \"debug\"); \n        \nSystem.setProperty(\"org.apache.commons.logging.simplelog.log.org.apache.commons.httpclient\", \n\"debug\"); \n        \n        String url = \"http://www.ibiblio.org/maven\";\n        \n        HttpClient client = new HttpClient();\n        GetMethod get = new GetMethod(url);\n        \n        client.executeMethod(get);        \n        get.getResponseBody();\n\nThe request was redirected successfully.  There are also a number of test cases for redirects that \nwork with HEAD.  Is must be something about how HttpClient is configured or being called.  Can \nyou provide a test case and/or a wire log <http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/\nlogging.html>?\n\nThanks,\n\nMike",

As you point out the problem is in using the\nMultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager, and in particular the HttpConnectionAdapter.\n The connection is being released by HeadMethod because the\nHttpConnectionAdapter is not aware of the new 'locked' option.  This is clearly\na bug.  I will work on a solution.\n\nThanks,\n\nMike",
