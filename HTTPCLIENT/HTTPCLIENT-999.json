Note that these only test \"single-value\" headers (like Date) and not to \"multi-value\" headers (like Cache-Control), because we already have tests in TestProtocolRequirements that govern keeping multi-valued end-to-end headers in the same order (which is a MUST for a transparent proxy).\n\nThis patch is contributed to the ASF with the permission of my employer.\n",
