            "body": "I have attached a patch to address this issue. Please note that this patch also includes the HttpParams-style configuration patch that was posted for issue 972:\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HTTPCLIENT-972\n\n(If you need me to rebuild this because you have already applied said patch for issue 972, I'm happy to do so).\n\nMajor changes in this patch are to extract an AbstractProtocolTest superclass from TestProtocolRequirements, so that we can inherit from this for a new test class, TestProtocolAllowedBehavior (i.e. things where the HTTP/1.1 spec says we MAY do something). All MUST requirements currently under test still pass, but now we cache responses for the items mentioned in this issue if we are a non-shared (private) cache.\n\nThis patch is contributed to the ASF with the permission of my employer.",

    "description": "Currently the CachingHttpClient only behaves as a shared cache, which is a safe and conservative assumption. However, in some settings, it would be appropriate to be able to configure the CachingHttpClient as a non-shared cache, which would make more responses cacheable, including:\n* responses to requests with Authorization headers\n* responses with 'Cache-Control: private'\n* ability to serve stale responses when invalidation fails for 'Cache-Control: proxy-revalidate'\n",
