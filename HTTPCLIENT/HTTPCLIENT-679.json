This class has been replaced with the standard java.net.URI class in HttpClient 4.0. If you are prepared to contribute a fix for the problem I'll happily review it and check it to the repository, but I seriously doubt any of us would be willing to invest any time into fixing old URI code in HttpClient 3.x. \n\nOleg",

            "body": "Wow, that class is a steaming pile.  It's a miracle it works as well as it does.\n\nRegardless, for now it is easier to fix HTTPClient than to change Heritrix over to use the java.net class (which has its own bugs to be worked around).  \n\nHere is a patch for the URI class that changes it to follow the RFC behavior in this case.  I have updated the URI class and the corresponding test to follow the RFC.  \n\nOleg, it would be great if you could review this.\n\nRoland, I firmly believe that it is better to fix a major bug that violates a basic case in the RFC than to not fix it and release a final version with a major flaw.  Feel free to add a switch to make it backwards compatible, if this is a hard requirement.",
