            "body": "The question which I think needs to be answered is whether separate PostXML and\nPostSOAP examples are desirable. I could change PostSOAP to support both sets of\nfunctionality using an optional parameter, e.g. -soapaction <soapaction>. If the\nsoapaction argument is missing it would behave the same as PostXML. The example\nwould have a little bit more logic which isn't necessarily a good thing for an\nexample but it would remove the duplication of code between the two files (as\nthere would then only be one). If people prefer we could keep the name PostXML\neven though it supported SOAP as well.",
