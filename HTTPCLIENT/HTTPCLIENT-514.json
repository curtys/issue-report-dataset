    "description": "Using a Squid2.4 proxy, the connection is dropped when trying to connect to a \nssl site. In order for the connection to remain open, preemptive authorization \nis needed for the proxy. The preemptive authorization flags are not propagated \ndown to where the ssl tunnel is created in HttpMethodDirectors executeConnect \nmethod. A new ConnectMethod object is created for the tunnel but the preemptive \nflags set as parameters are not being set on the new ConnectMethod object.\n\nHere is the code that would replicate the problem using a Squid(2.4) proxy :\n\nHttpClient client = new HttpClient();\nclient.getHostConfiguration().setProxyHost(new ProxyHost(\"someproxy\", 3128));\nclient.getParams().setAuthenticationPreemptive(true);\nclient.getState().setProxyCredentials(AuthScope.ANY, new \nUsernamePasswordCredentials(\"user\", \"password\"));\nGetMethod httpget = new GetMethod(\"https://www.verisign.com/\");\nhttpget.getProxyAuthState().setPreemptive();\nclient.executeMethod(httpget);\nhttpget.releaseConnection();",
