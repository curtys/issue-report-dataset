    "description": "I noticed that the Retry handler mechanism does not work when the client cannot\ninitiate a connection (which throws java.net.ConnectionException). This happens\nfor me for instance when there is proxy and a tunneling in the picture and\nsometimes there are connectivity problems.\n\nI had my own RetryHandler, however, the Connection Timeout exception never falls\nin it. I took a look at the source code and noticed that the open() method and\nany thrown exception at this level occurs outside the control of the Retry\nHandler (which seems to be involved only after open() succeeds).\n\nIn fact, if the open() throws ConnectionException (as is my case), since the\ntry/catch wrapping the open() is not inside the while() but on top of it, it\nstops the loop and the retry handler does not get a chance to be invoked .\n\nriad",
