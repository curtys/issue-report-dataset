However, the encoding properties should be set to ensure that source files are compiled correctly, resources are filtered appropriately and that the reports are using a consistent encoding.\n\nRelated info\nhttp://docs.codehaus.org/display/MAVENUSER/POM+Element+for+Source+File+Encoding\nhttp://docs.codehaus.org/display/MAVEN/Reporting+Encoding+Configuration",
