The DefaultRedirectStrategy class in 4.1 has a very similar method \n\nprotected URI createLocationURI(final String location) throws ProtocolException;\n\nI can commit the patch but it is very unlikely there will be another official release off the 4.0.x branch. Please consider upgrading to 4.1.\n\nOleg ",
