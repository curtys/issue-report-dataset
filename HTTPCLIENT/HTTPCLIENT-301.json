            "body": "Ludovic,\nIn my opinion the cookie is clearly wrong. Somehow I do not feel like patching\nHttpClient because of evey single broken cookie out there.\n\nBesides, your patch seems to fail to take into consideration that cookie domain\nmay be a just a simple host name (localhost for instance). Of course, I might\nhave missed something after a just cursory examination, but your patch does not\nseem right in that regard. I'll have a closer look at the issue on Monday, but\nat the moment I lean towards not changing HttpClient 2.0 at all. \n\nIn the next release we'll provide a plug-in mechanism for custom cookie specs,\nwhich would enable you to accept any kind of broken cookie you please. Cookie\nspec plug-in mechanism is already implemented in CVS HEAD, so feel free to take\na look.\n\nRegards,\n\nOleg",

The *host*\nsourceforge.net is not matched by the *domain* .sourceforge.net,\nand therefore the cookie is rejected.\n\nThe best fix would be to change your target URL to use a host within the\ndomain .sourceforge.net, like:\n\nhttps://www.sourceforge.net/account/login.php\nhttps://login.sourceforge.net/account/login.php\nhttps://whatever.sourceforge.net/account/login.php\n\nSourceforge indeed has an inappropriate login link on their page, but\nI cannot imagine they don't have a hostname that can be preprended.\nYou should ask them to chance their default login link accordingly.\n\nregards,\n  Roland",

The problem really lies with sourceforge, and most likely there is another \nlogin URL with an appropriate domain.  \n\nAs for custom cookie policies you should be able to register and use another cookie policy using \nsomething like:\n\nCookiePolicy.registerCookieSpec(\"mycookies\", someCookieSpec);\nHttpMethod someMethod = ...;\nsomeMethod.getParams().setCookiePolicy(\"mycookies\");\n\nPlease let us know if this doesn't work properly.\n\nMike",

I've been looking at the spec and \nthe definition of the \"domain-match\" function is pretty vague.  The general wisdom seems to \nindicate that \"domain.com\" should not match \".domain.com\", but I think allowing it is pretty safe \nfrom a security standpoint.  \n\nI've also noticed that the current domain match implementation matches \"y.x.foo.com\" with \n\".foo.com\", though this is explicitly disallowed in the RFC.

Here's a snippet from\nRFC 2965, section 1, page 1:\n\n>   Note that domain-match is not a commutative operation: a.b.c.com\n>   domain-matches .c.com, but not the reverse.\n\nBut here is something from section 3.2.2, page 5:\n\n>   Domain=value\n>      OPTIONAL.  The value of the Domain attribute specifies the domain\n>      for which the cookie is valid.  If an explicitly specified value\n>      does not start with a dot, the user agent supplies a leading dot.\n\nSo it seems it is an HttpClient bug after all. We have to add the missing\ndot when cookies are parsed.\n\ncheers,\n  Roland\n",

The cookie is parsed correctly, the\nproblem lies with the hostname.\n\nHowever, I do wonder whether there is some redirect involved. If\nsourceforge.net sends a redirect to www.sourceforge.net, the redirect\nis chased by HttpClient, and www.sourceforge.net sends a cookie for\ndomain .sourceforge.net, will that cookie be verified against host\nsourceforge.net or against host www.sourceforge.net?\n\nI'm just guessing here. I don't have a sourceforge account to verify\nthe behaviour. I just find it hard to imagine that browsers actually\naccept a cookie outside of the host's domain. Browser makers have\ngotten a lot of public beating for security bugs lately, and I'd\nconsider this to be one.\n",

However, in\nbrowser compatibility mode I do not think we should change the way domains are\nmatched, as the RFC compliance was relaxed a year ago precisely in order to\nmimic the logic (or lack thereof) of mainstream browsers. Someone even took a\nlook at Mozilla's source code to double-check on that.\n\nRoland,\nI still must have a dormant Sourceforce account. I'll take a closer look at the\nSourceforce login procedure and provide a patch for our browser compatibility\ncookie spec if required\n\nOleg",
