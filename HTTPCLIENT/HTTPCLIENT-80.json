Chunking requests can be set when using the \nHttpConnection method <code>public OutputStream getRequestOutputStream(boolean \nuseChunking)</code>\n\nThe PutMethod does allow for chunking with the funky call \n<code>conn.getRequestOutputStream((isHttp11() && (null == getRequestHeader\n(\"Content-Length\"))</code> and then writes to the output stream.\n\nBut the PostMethod just calls con.write directly, so the chunking code in the \nstream is bypassed.  This seems like a reasonable request to do in the 2.0 \ntimeframe.\n\n",
