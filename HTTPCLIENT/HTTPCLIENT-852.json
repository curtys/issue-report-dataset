            "body": "I examined the logs and that is what I have found so far: \n\nThe bug in HttpClient is triggered only when the redirect needs to be retried for some reason, for instance, due to an I/O error. There appears to be a bug Tinyproxy's connection management code causing a perfectly re-usable HTTP/1.1 connection to be dropped without proper notification of the client. The proxy should have sent the 'Connection: close' if it was not going to re-use HTTP/1.1connection). HttpClient assumes that the connection is still good, executes the redirect on the same connection, which fails because the connection has been closed on the proxy side. The second retry fails because HttpClient mistakenly assumes the URI has already been visited.\n\nWhile Tinyproxy's behavior is clearly broken, HttpClient should also be able to deal with failed redirects and retry those correctly. The fix for this issue, however, will require quite a bit of refactoring in the DefaultRequestDirector and DefaultRedirectHandler and may take a few days to complete. \n\nOleg",
