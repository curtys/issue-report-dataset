Having said that it does seems somewhat unclean to \nleave this open.  I'll make getDefaultParams() synchronized in CVS shortly.\n\nMike",

            "body": "Yes, calling createParams() twice is ok.  This is a bug about assigning to a \nreference variable which is shared between threads without using \nsynchronization.  That can have what the Java Language Specification Chapter \n17 calls \"surprising\" consequences.  Thanks for synchronizing it.",

    "description": "The method getDefaultParams() in \norg.apache.commons.httpclient.params.DefaultHttpParamsFactory is not thread \nsafe.  In this code:\n\n    public HttpParams getDefaultParams() {\n        if (httpParams == null) {\n            httpParams = createParams();\n        }\n\n        return httpParams;\n    }\n\nit is possible that httpParams will be called by one thread which will set \nhttpParams, then a second thread may call it and may find httpParams is \nnon-null.  However, under both the old (Java Language Spec chapter 17) and \nnew Java Memory Models, the second thread won't necessarily see the values \nthe first thread has set in the referenced HttpParams object.\n\nThe easiest way to fix this for all JVMs and memory models is by declaring \ngetDefaultParams() to be synchronized.",
