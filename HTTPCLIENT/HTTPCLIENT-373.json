The method\ncould accept one argument. A negative value could indicate that the SO_LINGER\nshould be disabled.\n- Add method getSoLinger() that returns the current setting for SO_LINGER. A\nnegative value would indicate that the SO_LINGER option is disabled.\n\nSee:\nhttp://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/net/Socket.html#setSoLinger(boolean,%20int)",
