            "body": "Oleg\nThank you for response. \nI am using HttpClient code to access http(s) resources. For example  http(s)://www.verisign.com.\nMy code is deployed under an application server which is located below three firewalls and that needs to connect through 3 proxies to reach the final target.\nFor example I have following 3 proxies and target\nproxy1:9999\nproxy2:7777\nproxy3:5555\nhttp(s)://www.verisign.com\nFirst I need to open a socket and connect to proxy1:9999 and then connect proxy2:7777 and then connect to proxy3:5555 to reach the target resource.\nCurrently HttpClient supports one proxy and i need to goes through more than one proxies. So i had to modify HttpMethodDirector class to tunnel the socket through the proxies.\nregards\n\n",

            "body": "Murty, \n\nI think this kind of functionality is usually referred to as proxy chaining. Presently HttpClient does not support it and see no easy and elegant way of adding it to the HttpClient 3.x code line. HttpClient is currently undergoing a complete redesign and we certainly could add support for proxy chaining to HttpClient 4.0. \n\nOleg",

            "body": "Ronald\n    Thanks for reply. I think this use case is real use case. Most of the comanies and people are using java on middle tier that locates behind firewalls.  \nWe can plugging through more than one proxies but that is really not secured.  \nOther solution is to write custom protocol handler to support multiple proxiesc but  HttpClient does not support it since it does not use URLStreamHandler internally.\nI think there is no other solution with HttpClient to support multiple proxies at this time.\nI have customized HttpClient and HttpMethodDirector classes to tunnel through configured number of proxies and working fine.\nPlease consider it for next major release.\nregards\nMurty\n",

Now I wait for someone with the requirement to layer tunnels, and my happiness will be complete.\nIt's going to be a tough nut to crack, since each proxy in a chain may also need a different proxy authentication. I'll keep pondering it (with low priority though).\n\ncheers,\n  Roland\n",
