    "description": "Thanks to Christian Kohlschuetter and Odi we now have a very flexible testing\nframework, which enables us to emulate pretty much all the aspects of a HTTP\nserver functionality including non-compliant behavior and various vendor\nspecific implementation quirks. \n\nMany, many thanks go to Christian Kohlschuetter for having contributed the\noriginal code. \n\nI propose SimpleHttpConnection be deprecated and eventually be phased out. I\ntook the first steps toward this goal by migrating Basic authentication test\ncases. I urge all committers and contributors to use SimpleHttpServer for all\nthe new cases from now on. Ideally in the future we should even be able to get\nrid of Tomcat as a dependency for testing.\n\nI also took liberty of tweaking the SimpleHttpServer API a little. I factored\nSimpleRequest and SimpleResponse classes out and provided a new interface called\nHttpService, which can be used instead of HttpRequestHandler to implement test\ncases in a way very similar to writing servlets. \n\nI'll commit the patch shortly as it does not really touch any _productive_ code. \n\nOleg",
