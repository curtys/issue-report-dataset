    "description": "I use a custom socket implementation with HttpClient, and am having problems \ngetting secure connections through a proxy working.\n\nHttpClient requires that my SecureProtocolSocketFactory be able to create a \nsecure socket layered over an existing insecure socket, but does not specify \nhow that insecure socket is created. Currently, for secure proxied \nconnections, the insecure connection is always created using a \nDefaultProtocolSocketFactory (HttpConnection.java, line 702). I wish to be \nable to override this behaviour, so that I can create the insecure socket \nusing my own custom implementation.\n\nThe problem with the default behaviour is that my custom socket implementation \nis written in C++ using JNI, and the SSL implementation is handled at the \nnative level. Hence, layering over an existing JDK socket will not work.\n\nMy proposed solution is to add an HTTP connection parameter to specify the \nsocket factory to use, perhaps http.connection.insecuresocketfactory of type \nClass.",
