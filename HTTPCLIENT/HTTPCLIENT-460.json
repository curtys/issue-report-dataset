It appears that the only significant extension\nis introduction of charset attribute, that defines char encoding of user\ncredentials, which sort of makes sense. \n\nI think there's no need to provide a Windows specific auth scheme just because\nof that. I just ended up patching the standard DigestScheme to make use of\ncharset attribute when present\n\nOleg",
