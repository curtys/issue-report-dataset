I don't have\nVisualAge, only Eclipse and Sun runtimes so can't test any patch either but will\ntake your word for it as long as jdk1.2.2 and j2sdk1.4.1 are still OK.\n",

I tried to get IBM's 1.2.2\nJDK but it seems that it is no longer available.  Only 1.3 is on their site now\nand it does not seem to be as picky.  Just to note, Visual Age is nearly at its\nend of life.  IBM will no longer be supporting it after the end of the year. \nThey are recommending that people upgrade to WebSphere Application Developer,\nwhich is just Eclipse plus some extras like hooks into WebSphere.\n\nMike",

    "description": "This was observed with IBM VisualAge 3.5, which runs JDK1.2.2:\n\nImporting the HTTPClient source code into the IDE brings up a\ncompilation error in \n\norg.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodBase.\n\nThe initialization of \"private ResponseConsumedWatcher m_responseWatcher\"\nusing an anyonymous inner class seems to cause some trouble. Implicated code:\n\nprivate ResponseConsumedWatcher m_responseWatcher = new ResponseConsumedWatcher\n() {\n\tpublic void responseConsumed() {\n\t\tresponseBodyConsumed();\n\t}\n};\n\nThe error message is: \"Field initialization: The constructor invoked to create\norg.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodBase$1 with arguments () is not defined\"\n\n...but only in the context of HttpMethodBase(String uri) constructor, i.e.\nthe HttpMethodBase() constructor *can* be compiled, HttpMethodBase(String uri)\n*cannot* be compiled with error \"Cannot create constructor due to incorrect\nfield initialization\".\n\nI interpret this to mean that the compiler is looking for a parameterless\nconstructor for the anonymous class in the context of \nHttpMethodBase(String uri). The message did not really make sense to me. \nChecked the syntax, checked in the Language Definition whether setting up an\nanonymous class like that is permitted; found nothing obviously wrong.\n\nFix:\n\nThe code above is equivalent to constructing the instance at the beginning\nof each constructor of the enclosing class. A copy and paste of the\nconstruction code into each of the two constructors fixes things...until\nthe next update.",
