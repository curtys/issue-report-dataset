It's a helper method used internally by \nCookieSpec.formatCookie(Cookie[]) to produce full-fledged \"Cookie\" header value \nthat includes a version attribute as well. This is more a documentation problem \nrather than a bug. Do you see it differently?\nOleg\n",

Would of course request they be\nclarified.\n\nAlso, if it's used internally, wouldn't it make more sense to make this method\nprivate?  I haven't had time to dig in here to see if there are any reasons to\nkeep it public.  Just a thought.\n\n",

The trouble is that this method is\ndeclared by CookieSpec interface and therefore cannot be made protected (correct\nme if I am wrong)). I believe making this method produce fully RFC compliant\n\"Cookie\" header value is a better, cleaner solution. Bug accepted",
