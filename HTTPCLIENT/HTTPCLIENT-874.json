Some applications may find this useful, but cannot really utilize these objects since there is only MultipartEntity.addPart(String name,ContentBody) and FormBodyPart does not have a getContent method:\n\n  entity.addPart(part.getName(), part.getContent()); // Almost but there is no getContent method\n\nHow about overriding addPart to take a FormBodyPart object:\n\n  entity.addPart(part);",
