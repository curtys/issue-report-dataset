For httpcore I can generate a jar in target.\nCan you find an error in the log, see below ?\nCan you please sent me a jar based on trunk, because I have to forward it to a project, I did only the PoC.\nCheers, Angela\n\nC:\\Data\\projects\\wstip50_eclipse35\\httpclient-trunk>C:\\Data\\projects\\maven\\apache-maven-2.2.1\\bin\\mvn package \n[INFO] Scanning for projects... \n[INFO] Reactor build order: \n[INFO]   HttpComponents Client \n[INFO]   HttpClient \n[INFO]   HttpMime \n[INFO]   HttpClient Cache \n[INFO]   HttpClient OSGi bundle \n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n[INFO] Building HttpComponents Client \n[INFO]    task-segment: [package] \n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n[INFO] [site:attach-descriptor {execution: default-attach-descriptor}] \n[INFO] Unable to load parent project from a relative path: Could not find the model file 'C:\\Data\\projects\\wstip50_eclipse35\\project\\pom.xml\n'. for project unknown \n[INFO] Parent project loaded from repository. \n[INFO] Preparing source:jar \n[WARNING] Removing: jar from forked lifecycle, to prevent recursive invocation. \n[INFO] No goals needed for project - skipping \n[INFO] [source:jar {execution: attach-sources}] \n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n[INFO] Building HttpClient \n[INFO]    task-segment: [package] \n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n[INFO] [resources:resources {execution: default-resources}] \n[INFO] Using 'UTF-8' encoding to copy filtered resources. \n[INFO] Copying 0 resource \n[INFO] Copying 1 resource \n[INFO] Copying 1 resource to META-INF \n[INFO] Copying 1 resource to META-INF \n[INFO] [compiler:compile {execution: default-compile}] \n[INFO] Nothing to compile - all classes are up to date \n[INFO] [resources:testResources {execution: default-testResources}] \n[INFO] Using 'UTF-8' encoding to copy filtered resources. \n[INFO] Copying 2 resources \n[INFO] [compiler:testCompile {execution: default-testCompile}] \n[INFO] Nothing to compile - all classes are up to date \n[INFO] [surefire:test {execution: default-test}] \n[INFO] Surefire report directory: C:\\Data\\projects\\wstip50_eclipse35\\httpclient-trunk\\httpclient\\target\\surefire-reports\n------------------------------------------------------- \n T E S T S \n------------------------------------------------------- \nRunning org.apache.http.impl.cookie.TestBasicCookieAttribHandlers \nTests run: 32, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.11 sec\n\n\n\n\n",

I think one of the main reasons for choosing HttpComponents/Client is for its complete support for the HTTP protocol as per the specs. I doubt if one could easily do HTTP authentication, Cookie manipulation etc with just JSSE\n\ncheers\nasankha",
