I'm not\nsure how robust this is, but I think it's pretty close.  I do not know if we\nwant to try this one before beta1 but I think it should be pretty safe, with\nexception of those HttpMethods that do not extend HttpMethodBase (are there any?).\n\nOn a related note, as mentioned by Slavik, it seems that this has a fairly\nsignificant performance impact.  On average the runtime of the test-localhost\nwent from 10 seconds pre-buffering to 8 seconds post-buffering.  I do not know\nhow valid this will be in real life, but it was more than I expected.\n\nMike",

    "description": "--Posted by Slavik Markovich:\n\nHi all,\n\nThis is probably a known issue (but I haven't found the answer for it yet).\nI'm using httpclient to post data to a remote server but as far as I can see\n(using ethereal) the client is writing every line to the wire without buffering.\nAfter examining the code, I can see that the HttpConnection class is using the\noutput stream received from the socket directly.\nIs there a reason for the direct writing?\nThis is a problem for me 'cause the remote server sets a very low timeout and\nreturns a bad request response after receiving the request line (without any\nother header line or request body).\n\nCan I easily add a buffered behavior to the http client?\n\n10x",
