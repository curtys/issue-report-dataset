Unfortunately this introduces coupling between disparate clients.\nWhat happens if I write a \"CookiePerConnectionInterceptor\" which wants to put a CookieStore in the connection.\n\nSome other interceptor (written by someone else / another project etc) decides that It would like to put a Map of name values pairs in instead.\n\nOops - now the two can't work together.\n\nThe motivation for using an attribute based approach is that it's easy to scope your usage of it.",

            "body": "I also see potential issues with the connection bound state. HTTP connections are meant to be stateless. They can be pooled and re-used within a completely different user / security context. If a connection contains attributes that are user specific / security sensitive, all sorts of issues may arise, very much like with thread local variables. However, you already have this problem with NTLM and SSL connections anyway. So, this feature should be used with caution, but we should still provide support for it.\n\nOleg",

    "description": "It would be nice to have a way to attach user defined attributes to a connection.\nIdeally it'd be nice if such support could be added to HttpClientConnection, but understandably this may not be possible due to back-compatibility issues.\nSo, we could have something like HttpConnectionContext perhaps (or similar) with:\n\nHttpConnectionContext#setAttribute(String name, Object value)\nObject HttpConnectionContext#getAttribute(String name)\n\nThis would be made available in the HttpContext of a request (like the connection is today):\n\nHttpConnectionContext connectionContext = (HttpConnectionContext) httpContext.getAttribute(ExecutionContext.HTTP_CONNECTION_CONTEXT);\n\nThis would make a few things much cleaner to implement than they are today: The most obvious being my current use case of wanting connection isolated cookies.\n\nCurrently to achieve this goal we need to provide custom client connection + connection operator + connection manager implementations. Then there is no clean way to currently obtain the actual connection instance created by a custom operator in the HttpContext: As it's wrapped by the connection pool and #getWrappedConnection is protected - so we need to resort to reflection in interceptors.\n\nProviding a clean mechanism for attaching user defined attributes to a connection instance as described above would make such implementations far far simpler.\n",
