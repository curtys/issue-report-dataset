    "description": "Max-per-host settings for ThreadSafeClientConnManagers are currently stored in HttpParams, where the parameter value is a map from HttpRoute (formerly HostConfiguration) to Integer. This has several drawbacks:\n\n1) maintaining a map as a value in HttpParams doesn't match my understanding of how params should be used\n2) the maximums based on HttpRoute are really specific to the TSCCM implementation and not a generic parameterization\n\nsome of the options are:\n\na) revise to define a more generic parameterization approach\nb) revise into an implementation specific parameterization approach\nc) define an implementation (TSCCM) specific configuration interface and a default implementation keeping the map as run-time data\n\ncheers,\n  Roland\n",
