In its current form the patch introduces dependency on HttpCore SNAPSHOT, which means we would have to release HttpCore 4.0 beta3 before we could release the next version of HttpClient. Can this patch be committed after the HttpClient release? Alternatively would it be acceptable for you to move the IDN conversion code to HttpClient?\n\nOleg",

            "body": "Good point, Oleg. It may turn out to be important to have the IDN support for Cookies rather sooner than later. If it's a road block to release HttpCore before HttpClient, I would rather move the IDN code to HttpClient level. Because cookies are its only user at the moment. It may be useful for connection management as well (think of connection managers that keep a pool per hostname/port): when the initial request uses a Unicode-URL and a subsequent redirect uses a Punycode-URL an existing connection may not be reused because of a mismatch of the hostname. Which package should the IDN code go into?",
