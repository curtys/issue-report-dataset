Maybe we should not\nlabel it 'performance optimization guide' but rather something like 'best\npractices' as not all issues deal with performance only.\n\nBTW, setting up a Wiki would be a nice thing, so anybody could help improving\ndocumentation.",

Perhaps we should try to separate these two things and have \ndocs for both?\n\nI also agree that HttpClient is long overdue for a Wiki.  It would be particularly useful for adding \nresponses to the many questions we see over and over again, something like a combination FAQ/\ntroubleshooting guide.\n\nMike",

I think this document looks pretty good\nnow, though I agree with Odi that the \"Reuse the HttpClient instance\" seems a\nlittle unnecessary.  The only real thing I think we need to encourage reuse of\nis the connection managers.  This is covered some for the MTCM but we could\nstill use a little something in regard to the simple connection manager.\n\nMike",
