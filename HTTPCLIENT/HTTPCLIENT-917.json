The only thing we can truly _guarantee_ here is that you get full source code and _nothing_ else. \n\n(2) HttpClient 4.0 does a lot of things very differently compared to HttpClient 3.1, so there is really no way of telling whether the problem is still there without proper testing. However, just by looking at the code I do think HttpClient 4.0 is no longer affected by the bug.\n\nhttp://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client/httpclient/xref/org/apache/http/impl/client/DefaultRequestDirector.html#995\n\n(3) I will commit your patch to the 3.x branch tonight.\n\n(4) I am not sure I fully understand why you are not able to upgrade Lucene Connector Framework to the latest version of HttpClient and what this has to do with Debian stable. \n\nOleg\n",

            "body": "Hi Oleg,\n\nBelieving it is resolved is good enough for me - thanks.\n\nThe issue of adoption of 4.x is complex.  There are several stakeholders involved here, so maybe a little background will help.\n\nFirst, Lucene Connector Framework's code base was recently granted to ASF by MetaCarta, Inc..  MetaCarta works primarily in the debian world, and the debian world has limited itself to HttpClient 3.1 for the medium-term future.  Internal politics at MetaCarta make it hard for me to adopt packages later than those in the current debian distribution, but having said that, I can certainly lobby for permission to create my own httpclient 4.1 debian package for MetaCarta's use.\n\nSecond, let me put on my LCF hat.  For LCF's purposes, 4.x's approach of having Httpclient's NTLM support be optional and reliant on jCIFS is problematic as well, since jCIFS is LGPL licensed.  This is not insurmountable, but it is certainly a major complication.  Now, the MetaCarta LCF Apache grant included a patch file for HttpClient 3.1-2 which included code for all three tickets I've submitted - and also includes a fully granted implementation of NTLM for HttpClient, which I've attached to ticket HTTPCLIENT-919.  If you folks decide accept it, and use it in the 4.x code base, then our path to using 4.x in LCF is simply a matter of mechanics and time.\n\nFinally, my overriding goal here has been to start the process of reconciling LCF's version of HttpClient with the version being distributed, so this is hoped to be an ongoing discussion.\n\nHope this helps....\n\nKarl\n\n",

So we believe it does not violate anyone's copyright.\n\nNo warranty is granted that it does not violate any Microsoft patents.  However, please note that there are at least two other open source projects out there that distribute code that is functionally similar.  These are:\n\n- jCIFS (jcifs.samba.org), which you are familiar\n- curl, which I presume you have heard of also\n\nCan you clarify what patents you believe to be in play here?  We may be able to do some independent research to see if these concerns appear to be warranted.\n\nThanks,\nKarl\n",

The only group of people that can make definitive statements on the matter is the ASF legal committee. If they decide it is okay to use algorithms in the ASF code that may _potentially_ be covered by patents held by Microsoft, the matter would be settled. However, given the fact they have been unable to make up their mind about the use of LGPL code in ASF code for years, I would not be holding my breath.\n\nWelcome to the wonderful world of ASF bureaucracy.\n\nUntil this matter is decided upon by the ASF legal people I _personally_ will not touch Microsoft specific code with a barge pole. If MetaCarta, Inc have enough lawyers sitting around, good for you. I am just a regular guy writing code at his spare time. A mere potential threat of a lawsuit is enough for me.  \n\nI am aware of multiple open-source implementations of the NTLM protocol. However this is not a copyright matter, but that of intellectual property rights. This is about a liability for the use of Microsoft IP in commercial products, not for writing open-source code. The existence of open-source implementations does not prove or disprove anything.",
