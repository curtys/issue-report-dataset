In the most common scenario AuthScope is created by the user when adding credentials to a CredentialsProvider and at the point AuthScheme is simply not available. So, we cannot replace the AuthScope(String, int, String, String) constructor with AuthScope(Host, AuthScheme). One possibility could be to create AuthRealm class that is simply a wrapper around String.\n\nOleg ",
