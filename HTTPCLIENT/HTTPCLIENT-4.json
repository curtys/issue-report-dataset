    "description": "Chunked transfer encoding is not being supported transparently by the\nHttpMethodBase object, causing chunk data to be embedded in response body data\nand forcing the application to handle the HTTP/1.1 implementation of chunked\ntransfer encoding.\n\nThe included patch now properly parses chunk data as per RFC 2068 and provides\nbody content consistently, regardless of whether chunked transfer encoding was\nused by the server or not. This relieves the application from the requirement of\nimplementing RFC 2068.\n\nPatch sent to mailing list as per guidelines to address this deficiency.",
