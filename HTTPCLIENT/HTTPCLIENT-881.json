I came up with a slight variation on your patch that appears to fix the race condition while preserving compatibility with the original behaviour of HttpUriRequest#abort(). Please pull the latest code from the SVN repository, review the changes an confirm the problem has been adequately fixed.\n\nI did not investigate thoroughly why those test cases started to fail. It can well be the test cases are flawed somehow.\n\nOleg\n\n----\nResults :\n\nTests in error:\n  testAbortDuringConnecting(org.apache.http.impl.conn.TestTSCCMWithServer)\n  testAbortBeforeSocketCreate(org.apache.http.impl.conn.TestTSCCMWithServer)\n  testAbortAfterSocketConnect(org.apache.http.impl.conn.TestTSCCMWithServer)\n  testAbortAfterOperatorOpen(org.apache.http.impl.conn.TestTSCCMWithServer)\n\nTests run: 477, Failures: 0, Errors: 4, Skipped: 0\n----",

In AbstractClientConnection.java, it's possible for abortConnection and releaseConnection both to read shutdown as false and for both to continue execution.  ThreadSafeClientConnManager.releaseConnection is not thread-safe when two threads are trying to release the same connection.\n\nI am following these steps to demonstrate the race condition:\n1) Let abortConnection and releaseConnection both step through the line that tests whether shutdown is already set.\n2) Let the thread running releaseConnection run just past the line in ThreadSafeClientConnManager.releaseConnection that sets local variable reusable from hca.isMarkedReusable.\n3) Let the thread running abortConnection run to the same point.\n4) Let the thread running releaseConnection finish.\n5) Let the thread running abortConnection finish.\n6) Attempt another request to the same host.\n\nThese steps consistently produce the following error:\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: There is no entry that could be dropped.\n\tat org.apache.http.impl.conn.tsccm.RouteSpecificPool.dropEntry(RouteSpecificPool.java:244)\n\tat org.apache.http.impl.conn.tsccm.ConnPoolByRoute.freeEntry(ConnPoolByRoute.java:418)\n\tat org.apache.http.impl.conn.tsccm.ThreadSafeClientConnManager.releaseConnection(ThreadSafeClientConnManager.java:254)\n\tat org.apache.http.impl.conn.AbstractClientConnAdapter.abortConnection(AbstractClientConnAdapter.java:338)\n\tat org.apache.http.impl.client.DefaultRequestDirector.abortConnection(DefaultRequestDirector.java:1058)\n\tat org.apache.http.impl.client.DefaultRequestDirector.execute(DefaultRequestDirector.java:566)\n\tat org.apache.http.impl.client.AbstractHttpClient.execute(AbstractHttpClient.java:674)\n\tat org.apache.http.impl.client.AbstractHttpClient.execute(AbstractHttpClient.java:609)\n\t...\n\nI propose the following change to the current version of AbstractClientConnection.java:\n\nIndex: AbstractClientConnAdapter.java\n===================================================================\n--- AbstractClientConnAdapter.java      (revision 825909)\n+++ AbstractClientConnAdapter.java      (working copy)\n@@ -311,20 +311,24 @@\n     }\n\n     public void releaseConnection() {\n-        if (shutdown) {\n-            return;\n+        synchronized(this) {\n+            if (shutdown) {\n+                return;\n+            }\n+            shutdown = true;\n         }\n-        shutdown = true;\n         if (connManager != null) {\n             connManager.releaseConnection(this, duration, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);\n         }\n     }\n\n     public void abortConnection() {\n-        if (shutdown) {\n-            return;\n+        synchronized(this) {\n+            if (shutdown) {\n+                return;\n+            }\n+            shutdown = true;\n         }\n-        shutdown = true;\n         unmarkReusable();\n         try {\n             shutdown();\n\nWith this code change, the regression tests pass and, I think, the problem is fixed.",
