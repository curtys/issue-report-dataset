    "description": "Copied from my mailing list post, Oleg suggested I post it to JIRA for 4.0 fix.\n\ni am using commons-httpclient.3.0.1 and I am sending some requests\nthrough https protocol. I have a problem with a long creation of\nconnection if ip address of remote service is not existing. I think\nproblem is in the situation when https connection is not created and\nConnectException is thrown after connection timeout. This exception is\ncatched in HttpMethodDirector.java in method executeWithRetry. Then\nthe DefaultHttpMethodRetryHandler is called to recognize whether\nconnection creation will be repeated or not.\nI think, that special handling for ConnectException is missing in\nretryMethod of DefaultHttpMethodRetryHandler, because exception is not\nrecognized and connetions are created again.\nOn the other hand, ConnectTimeoutException is thrown after connection\ntimeout for HTTP. This exception is handled in\nDefaultHttpMethodRetryHandler and call is stopped.\n\nThese lines of code handle ConnectTimeoutException in retryMethod of\nDefaultHttpMethodRetryHandler:\nif (exception instanceof InterruptedIOException) {\n            // Timeout\n            return false;\n        }\n\nProbably this is missing for ConnectException:\nif (exception instanceof InterruptedIOException || exception\ninstanceof ConnectException) {\n            // Timeout\n            return false;\n        }\n\n",
