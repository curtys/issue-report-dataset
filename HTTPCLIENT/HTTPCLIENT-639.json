The code base is not suited to be run as a shared library, and we should not encourage that.\nBesides, the Maven plugin [1] that generates the meta information is a Maven 2 plugin. It relies on a\nJava tool that is ASL licensed. Enrique, thanks for the information. [2]\n\nHttpComponents - all of them - should make use of that plugin and ship as OSGi bundles.\nWe'll have to document how to run the code safely as a shared library. In particular,\nbundled applications need to shut down connection managers and/or NIO reactors on unload.\nShared resources like SchemeRegistry.DEFAULT must not be modified, and should not be used at all.\n\nI'll try to take care of this later this year. I need to learn Maven anyway.\n\ncheers,\n  Roland\n\n[1] http://cwiki.apache.org/FELIX/bundle-plugin-for-maven-bnd.html\n[2] http://www.mail-archive.com/felix-dev@incubator.apache.org/msg04056.html\n",
