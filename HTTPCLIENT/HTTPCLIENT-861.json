The URI resolution itself is handled by JRE code. I am afraid there is simply not much we can do about it. This problem should be reported to OpenJDK / Sun / Oracle developers.\n\nAlternatively one could consider contributing a new implementation of that method completely independent from JRE code, but I personally think we ought not duplicate URI functionality provided by the platform.\n\nOleg",
