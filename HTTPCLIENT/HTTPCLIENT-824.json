            "body": "I reviewed the code and found the following:\n\n(1) HttpClient correctly synchronizes access to its ProtocolProcessor instance variable. It also makes a copy of it before passing it the request director, so the master copy can be safely mutated while current requests are being executed. No problem here. \n\n(2) Things are a bit messy with HttpParams. BasicHttpParams classes is used all over the place. Decorating those with a non-public thread-safe wrapper inside HttpClient does not really help as the user can still mutate its state using the original reference. The problem can be solved only by introducing a public thread-safe implementation of HttpParams, which we cannot do until 4.1\n\nOleg",
