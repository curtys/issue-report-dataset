I'll clean up smaller things while writing test cases and leave the  big one (HTTPCLIENT-636) until we've got test coverage.\n\nIn org.apache.http[.impl].client are skeletons for HttpClient and HttpRequestDirector. They are good enough to make use of the connection managers and to communicate directly or via tunnelled TLS/SSL through a proxy as long as no authentication is required.\n\ncheers,\n  Roland\n",
