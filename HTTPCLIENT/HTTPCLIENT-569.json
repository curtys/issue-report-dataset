When I saw someone else's code using the same HttpState object across\nmultiple threads, I immediately changed the code to use only one HttpState per\nthread. Yes, their code was not written with threadsafety in mind, but\nfortunately I was able to find that person's problem AND this bug and be part of\nthe solution for both.",

    "description": "The HttpState class has a clearCookies method that is not synchronized but\nshould be considering it modifies an ArrayList (which is unsynchronized). All\nother methods which modify or read from the ArrayList are synchronized except\nthe clearCookies method. \n\nI stumbled upon this fact because a webapp I am working on that uses HttpClient\nthrew an IllegalArgumentException indicating that one of the cookies in the\narray returned from HttpState.getCookies() was null, which shouldn't be\npossible.  Upon further inspection and testing, the only possible option is that\nthe threadsafety hole left by the unsynchronized clearCookies method caused the\nissue.",
