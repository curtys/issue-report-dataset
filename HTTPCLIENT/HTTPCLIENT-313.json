Lastly, IMO, Notepad is a poor excuse for a text editor. I\nwould suggest using TextPad or UltradEdit as better alternatives.",

The releases are built on linux and as such use the standard linux\nEOL when they are checked out of CVS.  \n\nIf you know of a simple, automated solution to modify EOLs for the .zip archives\nin Maven, I will gladly accept it.  If not, I do not think this is something\nthat will be changed.\n\nMike",
