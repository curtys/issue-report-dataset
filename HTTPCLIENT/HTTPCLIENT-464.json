HttpClient will close the\nconnection ONLY if the server erroneously sends content body with 204 response,\nwhich is a gross violation of the HTTP spec, thus rendering the underlying\nconnection unreliable\n\nOleg",

This means that it \ndoes not have either a content-length or a transfer-encoding header.\n\nI could not see a unit test that covers this situation.  After adding a test I \nfound that it failed and that a one line fix was required in HttpMethodBase.\nSee the attached file for the new test and the fix.\n\nIan",
