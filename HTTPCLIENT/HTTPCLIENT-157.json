I hope you do not mind (I was at the client basically to\nwatch another fella do all the work and I did not know what to do with my idle\ntime there).\n\nOleg",

Base64 is still there, and EncodingUtil.formUrlEncode() needs to make use of the codec. \nOther than that it looks good to me.\n\nNow that we're making this move to codec, what do we want to do about the codec jar.  Do we \nwant to add it to CVS ala commons-logging?  \n\nMike",

At the very least we should be consistent. We should either add\ncommons-codec.jar or remove commons-logging.jar.
