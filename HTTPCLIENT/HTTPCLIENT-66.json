All test cases pass, which is a\ngood news. The only trouble is the use of Java 1.5 specific Arrays.toString\nmethod, which is a very minor problem. Otherwise it is a big step forward\n\nOleg",

This can\nespecially be misleading when HttpClient is configured to use the Netscape\ndraft or the browser compat spec. How about this fix? Let me know what you\nthink\n\nOleg",

I do not like the fact,\nthough, that cookie attribute handlers cannot be used polymorphically in the\nmatch() and validate() methods of the RFC2965 cookie spec. This patch is\nintended to address this shortcoming. It changes the interface a little and\nrestructures the code here and there, but overall it keep the existing design\nintact. Please let me know what you think\n\nOleg",
