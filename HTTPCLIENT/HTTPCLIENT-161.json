Using other\nmethods of uploading the file (in particular a PutMethod), I was able to then\ndelete the file after the upload.  Now that I am using the MultipartPostMethod\nobj for the upload, I am unable to delete the file (the return value is false,\nand there is no SecurityException being thrown - no SecurityManager even set as\nof this point either).\n\nSo, I guess my question is whether there is a call to the MultipartPostMethod\nobj that I'm overlooking that would release it's connection (I'm sure that it is\nopening an InputStream of some sort to read the file contents, in order to form\nthe HTTP message) to the file - so that I can then have unimpeded access to it\nfor other operations?",
