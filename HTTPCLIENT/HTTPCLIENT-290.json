This additional line in\nHttpMethodBase#responseBodyConsumed should take care of the problem. I'll submit\na proper patch later today.\n\n    protected void responseBodyConsumed() {\n\n        // make sure this is the initial invocation of the notification,\n        // ignore subsequent ones.\n        responseStream = null;\n        if (responseConnection != null) {\n            responseConnection.setLastResponseInputStream(null);\n\n            if (shouldCloseConnection(responseConnection)) {\n                responseConnection.close();\n            }\n        }\n        ///////////////////////////////////\n        this.connectionCloseForced = false;\n        ///////////////////////////////////\n        doneWithConnection = true;\n        if (!inExecute) {\n            ensureConnectionRelease();\n        }\n    }\n\nOleg",
