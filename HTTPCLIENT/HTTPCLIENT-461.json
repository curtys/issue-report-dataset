    "description": "An excerpt from Microsoft's \"How Digest Authentication Works\":\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/library/TechRef/717b450c-f4a0-4cc9-86f4-cc0633aae5f9.mspx\n\n<quote>\n* RFC 2617-compliant Digest Authentication challenges and responses must also\ncomply with RFC 2616: Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1 quoted string\nrequirements. This requirement particularly affects the use of backslash (\\) and\nembedded double quotes. Both must be preceded (escaped) with a backslash.\n\n* For example, domain\\username according to RFC 2616 is read as domainusername.\nThis reading is important because if an application sends information in this\nformat rather than as domain\\\\username, authentication fails.\n\n* However, because this is a known issue with domain\\username , if\nauthenticating with backslash encoding fails, Digest SSP attempts to\nauthenticate the response and assumes that the backslash is part of the string.\nThis behavior can be turned off by setting the ServerCompat registry key.\n</quote>\n\nReview and fix the ParameterParser class and classes implemeting CookieSpec or\nAuthScheme interfaces\n\nSee also PR #34909",
