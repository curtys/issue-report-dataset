The rationale behind this decision probably was HTTP spec compliance.\nHTTP CONNECT method was initially defined in HTTP/1.1 specification only.\nHowever, there are enough HTTP/1.0 proxies which implement certain HTTP/1.1\nfeatures, including SSL tunneling support. So, the decision to restrict HTTP\nCONNECT to HTTP/1.1 was certainly wrong. My bad. \n\nA patch coming shortly\n\nOleg",
