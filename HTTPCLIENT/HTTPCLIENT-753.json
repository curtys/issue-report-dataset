    "description": "We currently have a recursive dependency between packages o.a.h.conn and o.a.h.conn.routing, because routing depends on Scheme/SchemeRegistry. While these classes are used throughout the connection management code, they are not really part of the connection management itself and would therefore fit nicely into a separate package.\n\npreliminary list of classes and interfaces to move:\n- Scheme\n- SchemeRegistry\n- SocketFactory\n- LayeredSocketFactory\n- PlainSocketFactory\n\nsuggested package name: o.a.h.conn.scheme\n\nPackage o.a.h.conn.ssl can stay where it is, it only changes its dependency from conn to the new package.\n\ncheers,\n  Roland\n",
