            "body": "Bin,\nI see things a bit differently here. It is not HttpClient that fails to work\nwith IBM Web Traffic Express Caching proxy on https, rather it is IBM Web\nTraffic Express Caching proxy that fails to work properly. Sending 'connection:\nclose' header along with connection established response appears ... well... odd\nto me. So, the bug report should have gone to the IBM folks in the very first\nplace. \n\nNevertheless, HttpClient has been tweaked to ignore inappropriate 'connection'\ndirectives in order to make it more robust when dealing with non-compliant proxy\nservers.\n\n\nThe patch attached will also make HttpClient report a waring when an invalid\n'connection: close' directive is encountered in 'connection established' response.\n\nOleg",

            "body": "Mike and Oleg,\n\nFirst as confirmation, we are using an old version of the nightly build (0308 \nbuild modified by us).  I am not sure if we can afford to upgrade in this case.\n\nTo clarify the situation, let me give a brief description of our application.  \nOur application is actually a signed applet and the size of the applet is \nfairly large.  So we actually have our customers installing all the jar files \n(including httpClient) on the client machine.  The applet is used by several \nthousands customers worldwide.  As result, upgrading is a big deal (not simply \na technical decision).  The applet is using http/https to communicate with our \nweb/app server and httpClient is used for the http communication.  Currently, \nwe released our product with the modified 0308 nightly build (we could not make \nthe latest nightly build work within our release schedule).  After the release, \nwe made the attempt to find a way to work with latest build and with the great \nhelp from you guys we got there.  But the new code is not in the release yet.  \nAlso our average users are not very comfortable with computers so it is rather \ndifficult to make our users to test different scenarios.\n\nNow this bug is reported from the field and the customer is still using the old \ncode.\n\nNow come back to the bug.  If I read your comments correctly, then\n1. The bug was caused by the incorrect behavior of IBM proxy server (200 with \nconnection:close).\n2. The latest nightly build (or coming beta) will handle the error better, but \nit still would not work.\n\nFor point 1, I agree with that assessment.  \n\nFor point 2, I would like to know what will be the expected behavior (logging \nsome warning or throwing exceptions).  Given that I do not have the environment \nto reproduce the problem, I may have to let our customers do the test.  So I \nwould need to know what to expect.  \n\nFinally, I know that the httpClient is close to beta 2 and this should not stop \nit.  But I hope this can be addressed in some later version.  Our customer have \ntried to use our application with browser connection (one of the things applet \ncan do), it did navigate through the proxy server OK.  I would think that \nhttpClient can also work with the situation and find a way to work with \nthis \"incorrect\" proxy server behavior (may be ignoring the connection:close \nwhen 200 is returned?).",

            "body": "Bin,\nI apologize if mine of Mike's statements turned out to be confusing or\ncontradictory. \n\nIn fact, since beta-1 HttpClient does ignore 'connection: close' header (as well\nas all other headers) when Connect method returns status code 200, and therefore\nshould work with non-compliant proxy servers including IBM Web Traffic Express\nthat one of your clients is using. \n\nI stumbled upon the problem pretty much by chance just a day before you filed\nthe report.\n\nhttp://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/jakarta-commons/httpclient/src/java/org/apache/commons/httpclient/ConnectMethod.java.diff?r1=1.14&r2=1.15\n\nMy latest patch merely added a warning for non-compliant behaviour.\n\nI hope that clarified things a bit. \n\nOleg",
