I realized once we start hashing the keys there is a possibility (however remote) that we'll get collisions, so I am working on a not-overly-complicated solution to serialize the original URL key in with the cache entry itself, so it can be compared when we retrieve it. I'll be sure to go back around and add all the proper factory/interface/dependency-injection framework to make sure it's extensible.\n",

            "body": "@Sebb: I don't think this applies to us, as we're not using a HashMap. Rather, I'm applying a hash function to map one set of values (the URLs the caching layer uses as cache keys) to another set of values (keys short enough to fit in the 250-byte constraint). The actual data structure (if any) that might be affected here would be in memcached. However, I'm planning on using a cryptographic hash algorithm, so it's unlikely to be subject to the types of the attacks described in the vulnerability (e.g. the very simple hash functions commonly used for Object#hashCode()).",

            "body": "Ok, just checked in the implementation here. Worth discussing: I ended up deprecating one of the existing constructors (one that took a custom serializer) because I had to change the serialization mechanism to accommodate fixing this bug. I somewhat suspect few folks would have been using custom serializers anyway, but there is a new constructor and some new interfaces that can be implemented if custom serialization is still desired.\n\nI chose SHA-256 as the default hashing scheme here. Do you think it is worth implementing fallback algorithms based on SHA-1 or MD5? I'm somewhat inclined to just let others contribute them if desired. The current default scheme with SHA-256 essentially resorts to not caching at all if it can't find a SHA-256 algorithm, which might not be great for a default. Falling back to a weaker algorithm is probably not hard, so perhaps I'll look at that next.\n\nAt any rate, the KeyHashingScheme interface should let us also provide a prefix-naming scheme to solve HTTPCLIENT-1154 as well.\n\n@Clinton: does this work for you?",

So if multiple threads are trying to use MemcachedHttpCacheStorage (and even if they all have their own instance of the same), the MessageDigest class will always be using the same underlying instance and therefore one thread might stomp another while trying to generate a hash.\n\nConsider cloning the MessageDigest instance or synchronizing the creation of the hash.\n\nThanks.\n",

I'm going to research what the memcached client does when it gets a key that's too long; if it silently ignores it (i.e. doesn't do the put, and returns null for a get) or throws an exception we can catch where we can treat it the same way, then I'm ok not backporting this more thorough fix, as we won't have correctness problems (we just won't get effective caching, which while not optimal, is still compliant). If it truncates the key instead, though, then we could have cache collisions that would result in incorrect behavior, and I'd be more likely to want to backport the fix.\n\nI'll see what I can find out and will post an update.\n",
