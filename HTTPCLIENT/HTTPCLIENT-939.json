Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of the response SHOULD contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s).\"\n\nNow, in \"DefaultRedirectStrategy.getLocationURI()\", there's a ProtocolException thrown if location header is null.  \n\nif (locationHeader == null) {\n    // got a redirect response, but no location header\n    throw new ProtocolException(\n        \"Received redirect response \" + response.getStatusLine()\n       + \" but no location header\");\n }\n\nThe specs says \"SHOULD\" and not \"MUST\". ProtocolException \"signals that an HTTP protocol violation has occurred\", which is not exactly true.",
