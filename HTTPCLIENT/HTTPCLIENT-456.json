    "description": "This bug most likely occurs on all patforms and OS's, but I have only tested it\non WinXP.\n\nThe HttpClient.executeMethod(HostConfiguration,HttpMethod,HttpState) will\nreceive and throw an IllegalArgumentException stating that \"host parameter is\nnull\" when a  HostConfiguration object is passed in that ONLY has a proxy set\n(via HostConfiguration.setProxy(String, int)). Details to reproduce follow--the\nbug can be easily reproduced by using the Apache Axis 1.2 CommonsHTTPSender\nclass (with JVM system props http.proxyHost, http.proxyPort set):\n\nThere is a bug in the Apache Commons HTTP Client 3.0rc2 that does not set the\nhostname property\nin the <code>HostConfiguration</code> object if the following two steps\nare performed:<br>\n1. You call\n<code>HttpClient.executeMethod(HostConfiguration,HttpMethod,HttpState)</code>\nwith a <code>HostConfiguration</code> object and an <code>HttpMethod</code> object\n(created using the HttpMethod(String uri) constructor).This method \nis called in this exact way in the Apache Axis 1.2 client\n(CommonsHTTPSender.java lines 132 and 186).<br>\n2. That <code>HostConfiguration</code> object only has a proxy set (using\nsetProxy(String, int)). This method \nis called in this exact way in the Apache Axis 1.2 client\n(CommonsHTTPSender.java line 389).<br>\n\nApache Axis 1.2rc3 CommonsHTTPSender.java did not expose this bug in Commons\nHTTP Client 3.0rc2 because\nit set the <code>HostConfiguration</code> in a different manner, as follows:<br>\n1. Call <code>HttpClient.setHostConfiguration(HostConfiguration)</code> first.\nAgain,\nThe <code>HostConfiguration</code> object must only have a proxy set and no host\nname.<br>\n2. Then call <code>HttpClient.executeMethod(HttpMethod)</code>.<br>\n\nUsing the above steps (as in Axis 1.2rc3 CommonsHTTPSender.java, invoke()\nmethod), line 379 in HttpClient.java evaluates to true\nbecause the argument <code>hostConfiguration</code> is null (see line 324 in\nHttpClient.java) and the local \nvariable <code>defaultHostConfiguration</code> ==\n<code>HttpClient.setHostConfiguration(HostConfiguration)</code>\nwhich was set in item #1 above. The hostname then gets set in the\n<code>HostConfiguration</code>\nobject in line 384 of HttpClient.java.",
