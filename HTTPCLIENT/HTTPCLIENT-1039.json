The called method is private in AbstractHttpClient... and the calling method is public final.\n\nMarco",

    "description": "I am trying to execute an HttpGet with the following URI:\n\"http://www.foo.foo/doSomething.html?url=http://www.bar.bar/doSomethingElse.html\"\n\nThis leads to UnknownHostException\n\nGoing through the internal code, the problem seems to be in the AbstractHttpClient.determineTarget method:\n            String ssp = requestURI.getSchemeSpecificPart();\n            ssp = ssp.substring(2, ssp.length()); //remove \"//\" prefix\n            int end = ssp.indexOf(':') > 0 ? ssp.indexOf(':') :\n                    ssp.indexOf('/') > 0 ? ssp.indexOf('/') :\n                    ssp.indexOf('?') > 0 ? ssp.indexOf('?') : ssp.length();\n            String host = ssp.substring(0, end);\n\nThis code sets the target host to \"www.foo.foo/doSomething.html?url=http\" instead of \"www.foo.foo\". This obviously breaks the execution not far down the line... DefaultClientConnectionOperator.resolveHostname throws an UnknownHostException.\n\nFWIW the AbstractHttpClient.determineTarget method actually has access to the request URI object, which correctly states that the host is \"www.foo.foo\".\n\nSo why does it try to extract the host from the scheme specific part anyway?\n\nI hope this is useful... and if there is any workaround please let me know, as I'm stuck on this one.\n\nMarco",
