The nightly builds offer me a method to set \ntimeout on the HttpConnection object, however the \"official\" download doesn't \nhave this functionality. It's exactly this functionality I'm looking for, so a \nquick fix would be highly appreciated.\n\nQ. How safe is it to use the nightly build instead of the \"official\" download?",

Specifically, the HttpMultiClient related \nstuff.  Most of the changes in this area to complete missing functionality, but \nthere may be some changes to the API prior to the final release.",

Should I subclass HttpClient,\nand create a getClient() method?\n\nI'm tempered to re-open this bug, but since I'm a recent HttpClient user,\nI remain calm...\n\nPlease also note the related HTTPCLIENT-1.\n",
