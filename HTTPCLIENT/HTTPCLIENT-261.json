The 2.1 code handled the redirect correctly.  Please verify \nwhich version of HttpClient you are using.  If the problem persists please post sample code and a \nwire log <http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/logging.html>.\n\nMike",

Please see my wire log attached below.  \n\nFrom looking for your wire log it seems strange that the server is redirecting to the same page that \nis being requested.  Are you accessing the internet directly or do you have you have a proxy?\n\nAnyone else have some ideas?\n\nMike",

An example offending url: \n\nhttp://www.snowcrest.net/mice/mice.htm\n\nThe problem lies in HttpMethodBase.java version 1.177 at line 1225.  It does \nthe following:\n\n        if (getRequestHeader(\"host\") != null) {\n            LOG.debug(\n                \"Request to add Host header ignored: header already added\");\n            return;\n        }\n\nand there is already the Host header from the previous url request so it \nendlessly loops until it aborts at the max redirects (default is 100 I guess).  \nI commented this out and it worked fine.",
