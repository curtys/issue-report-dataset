You'll likely have to modify build.xml, build.properties.sample and some \ndocumentation files as well.\n\nI'm working on a few other changes that should make the build dependancies \nsimple to handle as well, so you might want to hold off for that.  Feel free to \nassign that bug to yourself, as I'm sure it will be a high priority feature.\n\nYou may also wish to consider the other logging bug to align all the useage of \nlogging levels to be consistant (should be submitted as a seperate patch).  \nThere might also want to get some discussion going on the mailing list for the \nrequirements for what the policy should be:\nhttp://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=10804",
