    "description": "The parameter ClientPNames.VIRTUAL_HOST allows the default Host header to be overridden.\n\nCurrently the code uses the HttpHost entry as provided, and does not automatically add the port suffix.\nThis means that user code has to provide the port - but only if it's not the default for the protocol.\n\nIt would be simpler for the user if the port were automatically added.\n\nIf the user does not provide the port, the code should derive it from the target URL.\n\nIf the user does provide a port number, then that should be used (as is done currently). \nThis allows the user to override the port (if that should ever prove necessary).",
