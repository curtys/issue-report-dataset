That is, there no Log objects should be created on a per request basis. Objects created in the course of request execution should be reusing Log object of the HttpClient instance.\n\nOleg",

Please advise.\n\nWhen I ran my manually patched version there was a performance improvement on a small number of benchmarks I ran (I am seeing upto 10% improvement in my threads dealing with responses).",

    "description": "Running JProfiler on a program that uses HttpClient with a ThreadSafeClientConnManager, revealed that 5% of the time was spent constructing Log instances in class ClientParamsStack.\n\nOleg did some further investigation and found that DefaultRequestDirector also has the same problem.\n\nA simple solution would be to make the Log a static member variable, and do this on all classes for consistency.  However this might not be the best solution for interoperating with some frameworks (see http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-commons/Logging/StaticLog)\n\nAnother solution would be to simply remove the Log from the affected classes, although they are presumably there for a reason...\n",
