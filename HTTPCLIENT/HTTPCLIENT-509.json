IMHO a entity should not care if it\n> is embedded in another multipart entity and the parent's boundary string.\n\nTo perform a multipart/related POST, compared to the MultipartRequestEntity I\nneed to change the Content-Type: header to use another base type and possibly\nadd a couple of additional parameters in it (start=, type=), by overriding\n#getContentType.\n\nAs the boundary of used in the Content-Type header, and then used in other\nplaces (in #getContentLength and #writeBody), I need to use the same boundary in\nthe overriden #getContentType than in these non-overriden methods.\n\nI hope this helps understanding the problem?\n",
