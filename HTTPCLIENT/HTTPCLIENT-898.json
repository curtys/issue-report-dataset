The list comes from the resolver in a given order for good reasons (see RFC 3484), and randomizing it will do Very Bad Things in some situations.\n- The address list can potentially be very long (20+ addresses). Trying to divide the timeout evenly between these addresses might not be the best thing to do. Most other libraries simply specify that timeout is done once per host tried, which would probably not be unreasonable here either.",

However I would prefer a more radical but somewhat cleaner approach. I am thinking about deprecating the actual SocketFactory and LayeredSocketFactory interfaces and all implementing classes and replacing them with similar interfaces that are multihome capable\n\n---\npublic interface SocketFactory {\n\n    Socket createSocket() throws IOException;\n\n    Socket connectSocket(\n        Socket sock,\n        String hostname, \n        InetAddress removeAddress, \n        int port, \n        InetAddress localAddress, \n        int localPort,\n        HttpParams params\n    ) throws IOException, UnknownHostException, ConnectTimeoutException;\n\n    boolean isSecure(Socket sock) throws IllegalArgumentException;\n\n}\n---\n\nAlternatively we could introduce a optional interface for multihome support, which would be slightly uglier but would allow us to continue using all old interfaces and classes.\n\nWhat would be your preference?\n\nOleg",
