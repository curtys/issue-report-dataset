I attached a new patch without\ntabs and with the junit test.  Having run the junit test, I found something else\nI'd broken in the digest stuff (assuming algorithm would be passed in, which is\nnot required).\n\nI'm not sure I'm completely comfortable with the unit tests, however, as they\nonly  seem to test that the authenticator and the digest get the same result,\nnot that the result is correct.  It would probably be a good idea to do a\nsimilar set of digest tests that include an expected digest response to validate\nthe algorithms as well.\n\nThat said, it's lunch time.  :)\n",
