            "body": "This patch adds the functionality to return 304s in response to conditional requests.\n\nCachingHttpClient now decides whether or not to return a 304 based on whether or not a conditional request was made and the present cache entry is valid.\n\nHttpCache#updateCacheEntry() is changed to return a HttpCacheEntry instead of a HttpResponse.  This approach seemed more natural, and allowed the logic for deciding if a 304 should be returned to be contained within CachingHttpClient, instead of straddling multiple classes.  It also allows conditional request logic to be independent of HttpCache implementation.  The tests were updated to reflect this change.\n\nThe logic for conditional requests was updated in CachedResponseSuitabilityChecker to detect more supported conditional requests and whether or not they pass.  These were made public so they could be used to check against an updated cache entry from revalidation.\n\nCachedHttpResponseGenerator#generateNotModifiedResponse() was created to generate 304 responses from cache entries.  generateResponse() was also modified to skip the check if the cache entry is a 304 since 304's are not cached in the module.\\\n\nUnit tests were added to verify the new functionality.  Also, I attempted to add some documentation to reflect public facing changes.\n\nThis patch was created by myself and Mohammed Azeem Uddin and is submitted with the permission of my employer.\n\nPlease let me know if there is anything that should be changed.\n\nThank you,\nMichajlo\n\n",
