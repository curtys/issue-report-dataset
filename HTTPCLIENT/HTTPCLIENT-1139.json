If the SPNEGO auth scheme fails NTLM authentication is not attempted due to HTTPCLIENT-1107.\n\nAnyway, please attach wire / context logs of both sessions (successful with 4.0.3 and unsuccessful with 4.1.2).\n\nOleg",

Upon upgrading to 4.1.2, NTLM stopped working.\n\nI tried both the new for 4.1 built-in NTLM and the \"old way\" of using JCIFS: client.getAuthSchemes().register(\"ntlm\", new NTLMSchemeFactory()); \n\nUsing wireshark I can see that NTLM auth is not even attempted using 4.1.2.    Rolling back to 4.0.3 immediately resolved this problem.",
