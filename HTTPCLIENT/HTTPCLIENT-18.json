It's not clear if this was just an oversight or\nif there was a deliberate decision to not support this combination for some reason.\n\nAssuming that it was an oversight, the fix seems to just require one more\nvariation of startSession() in HttpClient.java which would be the following:\n\n   public void startSession(String host, int port,\n                            String proxyhost, int proxyport, boolean https) {\n       connection = new HttpConnection(proxyhost,proxyport,host,port,https);\n   }",
