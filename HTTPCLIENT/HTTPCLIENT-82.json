However, I have some public interface that return\nHttpURLConnection and I cannot break that contract with Cactus users.\n\nI propose to write a HttpURLConnection wrapper for HttpMethod (I have\nactually already written it but I am currently testing it on Cactus and\nwill make a proper donation once I am sure it works - i.e all the Cactus\ntests pass as before ... ).\n\nI attach a preview of it for those interested.\n\nWhat do you think of including it in HttpClient distribution ?\n\nThanks\n-Vincent",
