But because this method is not flexible enough (one cannot change cookie\nspecs associated with cookie versions) I agree it should be deprecated\n\n> - All of the static methods in CookiePolicy should be grouped together.  \n\nI'll do so.\n\nOleg",

This would be instead of specifying \none of the three hard-coded policies.",
