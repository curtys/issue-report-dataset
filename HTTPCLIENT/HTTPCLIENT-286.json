            "body": "Hello Oleg,\n\nI have just taken a look at it. In combination with pluggable cookie policies,\nthis patch provides everything I would need. Cookies can be set manually, with\nor without being extended by the cookies from the HttpState. Resolving clashes\nbetween manually set cookies and those in the state is the responsibility of\nwhom who sets cookies manually. And someone who wants his cookie header to be\nremoved automatically shouldn't set it in the first place :-)\n\nNo, wait, there is one thing:  RFC 2965 in section 3.3.4 (last paragraph before\nthe note) specifies that cookies shall be sent in a defined order, those with\nmore specific paths preceeding those with less specific paths.\nConsidering the fuss of parsing manually set cookie headers, I wouldn't want\nthis to be implemented by the HTTP Client. But that should at least be pointed\nout somewhere in the JavaDocs. In HttpMethod.{set|add}RequestHeader?\n\ncheers,\n  Roland\n",
