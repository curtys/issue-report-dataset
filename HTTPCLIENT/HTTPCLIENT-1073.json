            "body": "Ok, after sleeping on it, I think the fix warrants a little deeper analysis than the patch I posted. For example, if the origin response is a 401 missing the WWW-Authenticate header, this is strictly non-compliant, but shouldn't affect the caching module, and a client not using the caching module would have to deal with this anyway; so this compliance test ought to be removed. I'll check the other ones -- there are only about 4 unit tests and associated code.",

However, if there are instances where this is not possible, it currently throws an exception without consuming the origin response body; this causes a connection leak if the general try..catch..finally pattern documented on the HttpClient interface Javadoc is followed.\n",
