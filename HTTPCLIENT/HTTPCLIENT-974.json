    "description": "The RequestWrapper does not use the headers of the request it wraps. Therefore the wrapper appears as having no header, while the wrapped request may have some.\n\nTo work-around that behavior, I have to call resetHeaders() on the wrapper just after having created it.\nThis method does the following:\n    public void resetHeaders()\n    {\n        headergroup.clear();\n        setHeaders(original.getAllHeaders());\n    }\n\nI suggest calling setHeaders directly in the constructor. Or at least highlight in the Javadoc that we should call resetHeaders().",
