    "description": "HttpClient 4.1.2 has a SPNEGO authentication that uses the Negotiate keyword.  But the MS IIS that I must connect to does not send back an WWW-Authenticate: Negotiate, but, instead, does send an WWW-Authenticate: Kerberos\n\nSo I used the NegotiateScheme.java and NegotiateSchemeFactory.java as a base to create a \"new\" scheme, called, KerberosScheme.java and KerberosSchemeFactory.java to make it work.\n\nEssentially I replaced every \"Negotiate\" scheme by \"Kerberos\", in the KerberosScheme.java, and removed the part of the code that tried, first, SPNEGO_OID, using KERBEROS_OID directly, instead.\n\nIt works fine for me, but took me a while to figure this out.\n\nThat why I think it could come on the new versions.\n\nI'll attach my version but it has no package - it was made only for a test project.  It's trivial to put it in the right place/package.\n",
