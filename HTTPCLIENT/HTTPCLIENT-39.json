    "description": "When a web browser receives a <i>401: Unauthorized</i> response code, the\nbrowser prompts for the user and password credentials for the requested\nauthentication realm.  An Authorization header is then sent for this request. \nHttpClient models this behaviour quite well.\n\nAfter the web browser has the authentication credentials for a given host, port\nand realm, it then sends the Authorization header for subsequent requests\npre-emptively, whithout need for a 401 response.  HttpClient always reqires a\n401 response before it will send out the Authorization header.\n\nAs <code>HttpClient.startSession()</code> will take a <code>Credentials</code>\nobject as a parameter as the default credentials, the default credentials should\nbe sent as part of every request in that session.  Some mechanisim for\nover-riding the default credentials should also be provided to be sent\npre-emptively.\n\nThe point of this enhancement request is to minimize the number of unnecessisary\n401 responses.\n\nIt appears that the simple solution might be to modify the logic of when\n<code>Authenticator.authenticate()</code> gets called in\n<code>HttpMethodBase.addAuthorizationRequestHeader()</code>",
