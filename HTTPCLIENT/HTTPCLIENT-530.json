For instance, I think it is just too late to\nstart introducing serialVersionUIDs in HttpClient 3.x. Can you also exclude test\nand contrib classes from the patch? There's no point in fixing those.\n\nAs to the findbugs build target and related classes, would it be a big deal for\nyou to port those to HttpComponents as well? \n\nOleg",
