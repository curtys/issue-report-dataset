            "body": "I only managed to do some cleanup HttpMethod and a little bit on HttpMethodBase\nand HeaderGroup.  It was a lot more work than I thought, and it's time for bed.\n\nI tried to specify the behavior of the functions more precisely than before,\nusing the HttpMethodBase implementation as a guide to what the functions do. \nHalfway through I started to wonder if this was a good idea, because there are\nsome functions where the current behavior is fairly strange and I'm not sure if\nwe want to codify it.  Please let me know what you think.  My opinion is that we\nshould be precise about what the methods do even if it's weird, because clients\nof the API need to know.  It can always be cleaned up in 3.0.\n\nMany of the methods interact in strange ways that I didn't know about\npreviously, and side-effects abound.  For example,\nHttpMethodBase.getResponseBodyAsStream() only works if a) the body has not yet\nbeen read, or b) the body was previously retrieved via a call to\ngetResponseBody() or getResponseBodyAsString().  Except that if\ngetResponseBodyAsStream() has been called previously and releaseConnection() has\nnot yet been called, it returns the same stream as the last time.\n\nOne more oddity: the generated documentation for HttpMethodBase looks odd in\nMozilla 1.4 on Windows XP -- the font looks larger and maybe different.  It's\nfine in IE.  Could someone try this too so I know if it's just my system?\n\nI'll attach the changes as a patch.  I'll try to do some more tomorrow.",

If the given cookie \nhas already expired it will not be added, but existing values will still be removed.\n\n - I also suggest rewording addCookies(Cookie[]) to something like:\n\nAdds an array of {@link Cookie HTTP cookies}.  Cookies are added individually and in the given \narray order.\n\nMike",

Unless you want the release version of HttpClient\ndocumentation to carry a thick Russian accent, please someone who speaks English\nnatively proof-read the documentation at least of the most essential classes.\nThat would be really appreciated.\n\nOleg",
