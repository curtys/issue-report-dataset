What we can do is to deprecate LayeredSchemeSocketFactory interface and create a new one (say, LayeringSchemeSocketFactory or some such) and provide a compatibility layer for LayeredSchemeSocketFactory similar to that for LayeredSocketFactory.\n\nOleg",

    "description": "We use a custom implementation of LayeredSchemeSocketFactory that manages a keystore location through HttpParams. That allows us to use different keystores on a per connection basis.\n\nWhen a proxy is used LayeredSchemeSocketFactory.createLayeredSocket() is invoked which does not have a parameter that passes the HttpParams along. In consequence certificate authentication fails in our implementation. Is there a reason why all other factory methods in the super class have an HttpParams parameter except for LayeredSchemeSocketFactory.createLayeredSocket()?\n\nThe downstream bug is here:\n\n369805: certificate authentication with custom keystore fails behind proxy\nhttps://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=369805\n\nAny input would be greatly appreciated.",
