    "description": "file: HttpMethodBase.java method: addHostRequestHeader\n\nHttpClient writes an empty Host header if the host is referred using IP address.\nHTTP 1.1 RFC is not too clear what should be used in this case. However, other\nHTTP 1.1 implementations (e.g. Java 1.4.0) uses IP address instead of dns name\nin the header.\n\nFurthermore, some HTTP server implementations (e.g. Jetty) will return \"400 bad\nrequest\" if it encounters an empty Host header. That may be a bug in Jetty, but\nit might be a good idea to use IP address in Host header to increase compability.",
