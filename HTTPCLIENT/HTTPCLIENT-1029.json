    "description": "If you google for \"http client\" or \"httpclient\" or \"apache http client\" the first result is always legacy Commons-HttpClient page.  If you follow the link, there's no indication whatsoever on the legacy page that its not the latest version, or that it's end-of-lifed.  Unless you're already aware of HttpComponents, there's no obvious way to find it from the legacy page.  The only reference to HttpComponents is actually in the 'History' section.  \n\nThe source for the legacy page should be updated to indicate Commons-HttpClient is an end-of-lifed project and should provide a pointer to the new HttpComponents page in a more prominent location.",
