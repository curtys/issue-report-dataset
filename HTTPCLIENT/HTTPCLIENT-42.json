    "description": "I have had several problems lately where I needed to truck backwards and\nforwards between bytes and base64. As I am using HttpClient, I know I have the\ncode in my proect, but I need to duplicate it into my own heirarchy to get\naccess rights. \n\nPlease make appropriate changes to Base64 (can be as simple as marking the\nencode and decode methods public) to allow outside use of Base64.\n\nWould be nice to extend Base64 to deal with multi-line Base64 content too - but\nI know this is outside of Base64 original intended use. But it would be useful. :)",
