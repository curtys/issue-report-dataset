I could try to test it myself but I'm in the \nprocess of changing jobs right now and I cannot say how soon I will be able to \ndo that. I will try to find the time, though.\n\nBest regards,\nBisser",

    "description": "Hi guys,\n\nPlease, consider the following imaginary and simplified code:\n\n\nURI u = new URI(\"http://some.host.com/%41.html\", true);\nHttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient();\nGetMethod method = new GetMethod();\nmethod.setURI(u);\nURI u2 = method.getURI();\n\nSystem.out.println(\"1. \" + u);\nSystem.out.println(\"2. \" + new String(u.getRawURI()));\nSystem.out.println(\"3. \" + u.getURI());\nSystem.out.println(\"4. \" + u2);\nSystem.out.println(\"5. \" + new String(u2.getRawURI()));\nSystem.out.println(\"6. \" + u2.getURI());\n\n\nThe result that you'll get is:\n\n1. http://some.host.com/%41.html\n2. http://some.host.com/%41.html\n3. http://some.host.com/A.html\n4. http://some.host.com/%2541.html\n5. http://some.host.com/%2541.html\n6. http://some.host.com/%41.html\n\n\nYou can see that for lines 4, 5, and 6, the URI suddenly gets escaped (the \npercent sign gets converted to %25).\n\nWhy is that? Am I doing something wrong? Is this the desired behaviour? I would \nhave expected to get the SAME URI back, without any escaping.\n\nBesides, I have another question:\n\nAfter executing a method -- httpClient.executeMethod(method) -- what will \nmethod.getURI() return? The URI *after* all redirections or the original URI? \nIt seems I get the URI *after* the redirections, which is fine, but the \ndocumentation doesn't say that. It only explicitly says that the getPath() \nmethod has that behaviour.\n\nBest regards and thanks,\nBisser",
