Either rethrow exceptions with a different type (rethrow checked exception as an unchecked one, if appropriate), handle it if it can be handled internally by the class or in extreme cases log it through commons-logging. \n\n(2) FluentResponse currently depends on JUnit code, which is not okay in my opinion. Since there was no response from the Stanbol folks I we do not really know how important it is for them. I suggest we either remote the JUnit specific code or at least move it to the test folder for the time being. \n\n(3) Some test coverage would be quite useful\n\nCheers\n\nOleg\n\n[1] http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpcomponents/httpclient/trunk/httpclient/src/main/java/org/apache/http/client/utils/UriBuilder.java\n[2] http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpcomponents/httpclient/trunk/fluent-hc/",
