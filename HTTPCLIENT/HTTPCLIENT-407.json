    "description": "There are some errors in the Javadoc for the HttpVersion class. This is the\nclass comment:\n\n *  <p>HTTP version, as specified in RFC 2616.</p>\n *  <p>\n *  HTTP uses a \"&ltmajor&gt.&ltminor&gt\" numbering scheme to indicate versions\n *  of the protocol. The protocol versioning policy is intended to allow\n *  the sender to indicate the format of a message and its capacity for\n *  understanding further HTTP communication, rather than the features\n *  obtained via that communication. No change is made to the version\n *  number for the addition of message components which do not affect\n *  communication behavior or which only add to extensible field values.\n *  The &ltminor&gt number is incremented when the changes made to the\n *  protocol add features which do not change the general message parsing\n *  algorithm, but which may add to the message semantics and imply\n *  additional capabilities of the sender. The &ltmajor&gt number is\n *  incremented when the format of a message within the protocol is\n *  changed. See RFC 2145 [36] for a fuller explanation.\n *  </p>\n *  <p>\n *  The version of an HTTP message is indicated by an HTTP-Version field\n *  in the first line of the message.\n *  </p>\n *  <pre>\n *     HTTP-Version   = \"HTTP\" \"/\" 1*DIGIT \".\" 1*DIGIT\n *  </pre>\n *  <p>\n *   Note that the major and minor numbers MUST be treated as separate\n *   integers and that each MAY be incremented higher than a single digit.\n *   Thus, HTTP/2.4 is a lower version than HTTP/2.13, which in turn is\n *   lower than HTTP/12.3. Leading zeros MUST be ignored by recipients and\n *   MUST NOT be sent.\n *  </p>\n\nNote that the character entities for less-than and greater-than are not properly\nended with a semi-colon.\n\nI will attach a proposed fix.",
