    "description": "I have an IBM WebSphere server that returns 304 responses with a Content-\nLength header set to something other than 0 and the server is not closing the \nconnection.  According to the HTTP RFC \n(http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3.5):\n\n\"The 304 response MUST NOT contain a message-body, and thus is always \nterminated by the first empty line after the header fields.\"\n\nObviously, the web server is returning a bad response but the HTTPClient \nblocks waiting on data in the response even though there shouldn't be any.  \nOther HTTP clients (browsers) do not have this issue and seem to ignore the \nfact that the server set an invalid Content-Length in the response.",
