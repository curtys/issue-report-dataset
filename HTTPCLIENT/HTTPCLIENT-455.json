    "description": "Attached is a zip file containing two classes - PluginProxyUtil and\nProxyDetectionException.  I've tested\nPluginProxyUtil.detectProxy(URL) on Windows XP(JRE's 1.3/1.4/1.5 with IE) and\nSolaris (JRE 1.4 with Netscape)\nand it correctly detects browser plugin settings.  I don't have access to MacOS\nX  to try it, but I doubt that\nit works there anyway based on Dmitri's comments here:\n\nhttp://forum.java.sun.com/thread.jspa?threadID=364342&tstart=120\n\nPlease change the header and package as necessary to include it in the contrib\nsection.  I plan to contribute\nan example Applet that uses this code at some point - our app is way too\ncomplicated to use as an example.\nIf you want to wait until that is done to include it, that's fine too.  Just\nwanted to offer this up now in case\nanyone else is looking for it.",
