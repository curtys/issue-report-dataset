            "body": "Mike, \nthere's a slight problem with your patch. Consider the following scenario\n(1) the user sets default cookie policy using the deprecated\n'apache.commons.httpclient.cookiespec' system property\n(2) that causes the cookie policy parameter to be created in the default\nparameter collection\n(3) which effectively renders HttpState#cookiePolicy having no effect\n\nIt is a fringe case but it is not totally impossible\n\nHow about this? (patch coming shortly)",
