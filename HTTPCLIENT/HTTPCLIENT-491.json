We might have to do away with\nthe ParameterFormatter altogether in order to be 100% compliant. Essentially I\n_believe_ this is an unfortunate inconsistency in the spec. For instance, if my,\nmemory serves me well, Apache HTTPD is not affected by this problem. I usually\ntest our Digest code against Apache HTTPD\n\nOleg",
