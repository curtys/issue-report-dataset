            "body": "So what this patch is trying to do is save on Object instances. I really wonder what kind of use case creates that many instances of HttpState that this is a problem :-)\n\nIt replaces the use of a CookieIdentityComparator with a static method. That's the part I disgust. It would be nicer to require CookieIdentityComparator to be thread-safe (Comparators are stateless almost always, so no big deal) and provide a static instance.\n\nIt tries to do the cookie expiry without iterator. It's a bit fragile like that, but should work. Just needs proper test coverage.\n\nI can't see any savings in the changes to getCookies().\n\nmatchCredentials has been inlined, because the static method has no access to initialize the non-static field. Could just as well make the method non-static.",

Creating a class for 6 lines of code if it is only used once doesn't seem right.\n\n> I can't see any savings in the changes to getCookies().\n\nAgain, a class cast.\n\n\nNone of these changes are major but if you accept them I'll go through the whole codebase and improve things bit by bit. That is the way I usually work.\n",
