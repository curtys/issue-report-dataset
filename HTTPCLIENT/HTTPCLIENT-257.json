    "description": "Currently the NTLM class attempts to load and register the Sun JCE implementation unless a \nSystem property is set to indicate a different JCE to use.  We should remove this entirely and leave \nthe installation and configuration of the JCE to the application rather than trying to do it ourselves \nas this could cause problems with other implementations of JCE.  I'll attach an initial patch for this \nin a moment, with a patch for the documentation in the morning.  (Writing docs at 1am is never a \ngood idea.)",
