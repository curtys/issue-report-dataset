            "body": "I'm not sure when or how this is fixed, but it appears to be working well.\n\nI tried it with both setting the default credentials as a startSession()\nargument and by adding particular credentials for a specific authentication\nrealm with setCredentials().\n\nIn HttpMethodBase.execute, the following code checks to see if an authentication\nwas done on the \"<path>:<type> realm=<realm>\" string.  If it has, then it breaks\nout and returns from execute.  If it has not been tried, it sets the\nauthentication and trys again.\n<code>\n                    if (realms.contains(pathAndCreds)) {\n                        if (log.isInfoEnabled()) {\n                            log.info(\"Already tried to authenticate to \\\"\" +\nwwwauth.getValue() + \"\\\" but still receiving \" + HttpStatus.SC_UNAUTHORIZED +\n\".\");\n                        }\n                        break;\n                    } else {\n                        realms.add(pathAndCreds);\n                    }\n</code>\nThat being said, the code above is in a for(;;) loop with some complicated code\nin it.  It does have some good error checking code in there for infinite\nre-direction and such, but I have not attempted to test all the possibilities.\n\nPerhaps the reporter of this bug could re-test and provide a more detailed test\nscenario if it still occurs.",

            "body": "Sorry for the delay, but I am again looking into this, as I am trying to use \nthe newest version of HttpClient and am having the same problem as before.  I \nam trying this with yesterday's source code (9/9/02).\n\nLooking at the code, it does not match the previous explanation (perhaps it's \nbeen changed again).\n\nAt line 701, in HttpMethodBase.execute():\n\n<code>\n  case HttpStatus.SC_UNAUTHORIZED:\n  case HttpStatus.SC_PROXY_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED:\n      log.debug(\"Authorization required\");\n      if (doAuthentication) { //process authentication response\n          //if the authentication is successful, return the statusCode\n          //otherwise, drop through the switch and try again.\n          if (processAuthenticationResponse(state, conn)) {\n              return statusCode;\n          }\n      } else { //let the client handle the authenticaiton\n          return statusCode;\n      }\n      break;\n</code>\n\nThe comment indicates that the code will retry if the authentication attempt \nfails.  This would make sense if an end user was being prompted for new \ncredentials, but this is not the case for me.  It will try the same credentials \nover and over (up to maxForwards=100).\n\nLet me know if you need more details.  Best regards, Paul.",
