    "description": "Attempting to extend the PostMethod class I discovered that I had no access to \nthe requestBody because the member is declared private and there is no get \nmethod.\n\nI was trying to override the setRequestContentLength() when I discovered the \nproblem.\n\nSo my enhancement request specifically is:\n1. add a get method to be able to get the requestBody (probably a get method to \nthe parameters as well)\n2. (optionally) make the requestBody and parameters members protected instead \nof private so extending the class is easier.\n\nIn case you were wondering, the reason for extending the class was to add the \nability to set a timeout value on the httpconnection and also the ability to \nset the character encoding of the request body.  I don't know if these are \nworthy of an enhancement request but I require them for what I'm doing.  Nice \nwork by the way.\n\nThank you.",
