There is talk of moving to regular \nexpression pattern matching for parsing, but that will not be a 2.0 feature.  \nHowever, we will correct this issue for the soonest possible timeframe, 2.0 \nMilestone 1.\n\nAs for which authentication scheme to use when there are multiple \nauthentication schemes:\n\n<cite href=\"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt\">\n4.6 Weakness Created by Multiple Authentication Schemes\n   An HTTP/1.1 server may return multiple challenges with a 401\n   (Authenticate) response, and each challenge may use a different\n   auth-scheme. A user agent MUST choose to use the strongest auth-\n   scheme it understands and request credentials from the user based\n   upon that challenge.\n</cite>\n\nThe behaviour in the citation is *not* the current behaviour of HttpClient.",

    "description": "My proxy server returns the following header lines in the response:\n\n    Proxy-Authenticate: NTLM\n    Proxy-Authenticate: Basic realm=\"10.105.20.201\"\n\ni.e., it returns two Proxy-Authenticate header lines. Unfortunately this does \nnot work. In line 253 of class Authenticator (method: authenticate(HttpMethod, \nHttpState, Header, String)) I see this comment:\n\n    // FIXME: Note that this won't work if there is more than one realm within \nthe challenge\n\nso it looks like this is something that isn't yet implemented. In the log, I \ncan see that the Authenticator attempts to parse the realm, but it looks like\nthis is not being done correctly:\n\n   411 DEBUG Attempting to authenticate challenge: Proxy-Authenticate: NTLM, \nBasic realm=\"10.105.20.201\"\n\n   411 DEBUG Parsed realm \"ealm=\"10.105.20.201\" from challenge \"NTLM, Basic \nrealm=\"10.105.20.201\"\".\n   421 WARN  Exception thrown authenticating\njava.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Authentication type \"NTLM,\" is not \nrecognized.\n    at org.apache.commons.httpclient.Authenticator.authenticate\n(Authenticator.java:274)\n    at org.apache.commons.httpclient.Authenticator.authenticateProxy\n(Authenticator.java:178)\n    at \norg.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodBase.processAuthenticationResponse\n(HttpMethodBase.java:580)\n    at org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodBase.execute\n(HttpMethodBase.java:668)\n    at org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpClient.executeMethod\n(HttpClient.java:355)\n    at com.cmg.httptest.Main.main(Main.java:34)\n\nIt looks wrong to me that the realm name seems to be parsed as: \nealm=\"10.105.20.201\n\nI understand that Authenticator does not know what NTLM is but I would like it \nto use Basic authentication in this case.\n\nIf there are more authentication methods possible, how can I specify which one \nI want to use?\n\nJesper de Jong",
