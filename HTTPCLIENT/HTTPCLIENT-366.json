However, the RFC number was not correct.\nRFC 1945 defines version 1.0 of the HTTP spec. It has been superseded by RFC\n2616 that defines version 1.1 of the HTTP spec. The reference should read \n\nThe HTTP POST method is defined in section 9.5 of <a\nhref=\"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt\">RFC2616</a\n\nOleg",
