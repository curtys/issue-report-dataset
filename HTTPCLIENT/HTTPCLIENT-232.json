We use JAXB to generate XML IO code from an XSD for\nthis XML config file. Right now, the default value in the XSD has to be matched\nby hand to the default values in HttpClient as well as our other settings. I\nwould like to be able to fill in the default values in the XSD based on\nconstants for all of the pieces that must be configured. This means that the\nreal constant definition is in one place and one place only.",
