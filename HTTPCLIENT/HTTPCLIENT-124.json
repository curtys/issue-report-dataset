    "description": "This is something of a collection of issues that are all interrelated.\n\n1. MultipartPost calls close on the outputstream it retrieved from \nHttpConnection which causes an exception to be thrown later on.  This call \nshould be replaced with a call to flush().\n\n2. The MultipartPost classes do not have any logging in them.  We should add \ntrace statements at a minimum.\n\n3. new FilePart(String, File) throws a null pointer exception.\n\n4. The tests in TestPartsNoHost are broken.\n\nI'll attach patches for these fixes in a moment, broken down as much as \npossible.",
