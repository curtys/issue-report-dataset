There should be no development activity for the notice plugin once it does what it is meant to do. I think the simplest solution to the problem is reverting back to the non-snapshot release of the plugin until 0.0.2 is released.\n\nOleg",

    "description": "Hi,\n\nthe httpclient build currently fails in Gump because it cannot find the maven-notice-plugin.  We could grab it from http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpcomponents/maven-notice-plugin/trunk/ but since you have a directory with externals just for Gump it would be a lot easier if you added an external for it as well.\n\nThanks\n\nStefan",
