In addition, we are now very explicit about not using cached responses for conditionals we don't currently understand/support, namely: If-Range, If-Match (for GETs), and If-Unmodified-Since (for GETs).\n\nThis patch is contributed to the ASF with the permission of my employer.\n",

There is a unit test for this already, but it is incorrect (it uses 'If-Unmodified-Since' instead of 'If-Modified-Since' in the test case).\n\n",
