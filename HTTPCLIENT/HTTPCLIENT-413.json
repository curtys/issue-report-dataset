            "body": "RFC2109, section 2\n<quote>\nHosts names can be specified either as an IP address or a FQHN\nstring.  Sometimes we compare one host name with another.  Host A's\nname domain-matches host B's if\n\n* both host names are IP addresses and their host name strings match\n  exactly; or\n\n* both host names are FQDN strings and their host name strings match\n  exactly; or\n\n* A is a FQDN string and has the form NB, where N is a non-empty name\n  string, B has the form .B', and B' is a FQDN string.  (So, x.y.com\n  domain-matches .y.com but not y.com.)\n\nNote that domain-match is not a commutative operation: a.b.c.com\ndomain-matches .c.com, but not the reverse.\n</quote>\n\nMarc,\n\nPlease correct me if I am wrong, but based on the above quote I believe\nHttpClient correctly implements the domain matching algorithm as defined by the\nRFC2109. If you are absolutely positive that (so called) mainstream browsers\nimplement a different domain matching differently, we may consider relaxing the\nbrowser compatibility spec.\n\nOleg",

            "body": "I faced the problem with htmlunit that uses itself commons-httpclient. Just\nafter having reported this bug, I've found that on the website I was testing on,\nthe problem was caused by an htmlunit \"feature\" that changed domain of cookies\nlike \"mydomain.com\" to \".mydomain.com\". This \"feature\" has been added for not so\nlong time and I currently don't understand why. I close this bug as invalid. If\nI get some feedback on the reason of the patch in htmlunit I will reopen it.\nSorry for the lost time.",

I was the one responsible for the bad patch in htmlunit that Marc\nfound.\n\nHowever, mainstream browsers like Mozilla 1.7.5, Firefox 1.0 and Safari 1.2.4\nall support this behavior.  I have also tested MSIE 5.2 for Mac, which behaves\nthis way as well.\n\nI have created a patch to CookieSpecBase.domainMatch() that fixes this issue,\nalthough it will change the behavior of the NetscapeDraftSpec subclass (since it\ndoesn't override the domainMatch() method).  This makes the\nCookiePolicy.BROWSER_COMPATIBILITY mode more...compatible...with browsers.\n",
