A char constant can be stored in 2 bytes, a string requires something like 24 bytes + 2 bytes for the actual characters.\n\nAlso consider the common case of appending a char and you can see there is a little bit less work involved:\n\npublic AbstractStringBuilder JavaDoc append(char c) {\n     int newCount = count + 1;\n     if (newCount > value.length)\n         expandCapacity(newCount);\n     value[count++] = c;\n     return this;\n }\n\nvs\n\npublic AbstractStringBuilder  append(String str) {\n     if (str == null) str = \"null\";\n     int len = str.length();\n\n     if (len == 0) return this;\n     int newCount = count + len;\n     if (newCount > value.length)\n         expandCapacity(newCount);\n     str.getChars(0, len, value, count);\n     count = newCount;\n     return this;\n }\n",

Here's some simple things:\n- Use character constants instead of string contstants\n- Use java 1.5 style for loops\n- Use StringBuilder where appropriate\n- Fix javadocs\n- switch somestring.equals(\"\") to .length() == 0\n-  simplify some boolean expressions\n- eliminate redundant initializers\n- fix some html nits\n- remove final keyword from static methods\n",
