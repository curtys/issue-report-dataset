For\na moment, I really thought something would be stored *in* it. I only\nrealized my mistake the very last moment before posting a comment that\nwould have been really embarrassing for me ;-) And someone else might\nget the idea of calling the setters on that one, too.\n\nLooks good to me.\n\ncheers,\n  Roland",
