            "body": "Jon\n\nHttpParams API often get criticized these days as being cumbersome and user unfriendly because it is difficult to manipulate with using DI frameworks. While there is currently no replacement for HttpParams when it comes to managing HTTP parameters that need to be settable on both per agent and per request basis, I am certainly guilty for having abused HttpParams in areas where simple plain java beans would have sufficed (mainly in HttpCore NIO). Since caching configuration does not seem to make sense at the HTTP request level, probably we should use plain beans for cache configuration? What do you think?\n\nOleg",

            "body": "I'm fine with a simple beans-style configuration for the Cache; I just tried to copy what was already in other parts of the codebase. :) \n\nI'm assuming something like a CacheParams class that starts with default settings, plus getters and setters, and then passing those as the constructor args where needed instead of HttpParams?\n\nI can take a shot at a patch for that.\n",

I have a patch with this update which I will upload shortly.\n",
