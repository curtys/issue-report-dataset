The method is so widely used, so I am really hesitant to make this\nchange, no matter how minor. \n\nI do agree the releaseConnection code is not ideal. However this is not an\nisolated problem with releaseConnection, rather an overall problem with the 2.0\nand 3.0 API that have been stretched to their limit. \n\nIf there are no load objections I'll mark this bug as WONTFIX\n\nOleg",

Connection cannot be relea\n        }\n    }\n\nSilently ignoring a request (to release the connection, in this case) is hardly\never the right thing to do, in my opinion. Instead, I suggest the method\nindicates whether the connection was actually closed or not.\n\nI see at least 2 alternatives:\n\n1) throw an exception to indicate the connection could not be released;\n2) return a flag indicating whether the connection could actually be released.",
