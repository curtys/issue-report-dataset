But the problem remains. \n\nI think I understand what happened, I did download beta-1, applied the\npatch myslef by hand and I made a mistake that made it work, but the patch\ncorrectly applied doesn't work. I think that only the patch on \nCookieSpecBase.java should be applied, the patch on \nRFC2109Spec.java stills throws an exception line 119. \n\nI mofified it today on a snapshot and it works for me. Simply remove\npatch on RFC21109Spec.java, so remove lines from 116 to 127 and line 128 \nreplace \"else if\" by \"if\".\n\nSorry for the mistake.\n\nMickael",
