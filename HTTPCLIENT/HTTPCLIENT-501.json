    "description": "Hi all,\n\nwe received this bug report for the debian commons-httpclient\npackage:\n\n<debian_bugreport>\nThe following bug is present in upstream, 2.0.2 and 3.0RC3, at least as far\nas I can tell by testing.\n\nThe specification grammar for the Cookie and Cookie2 HTTP headers\n(specified by RFC 2109 section 4.3.4, and RFC 2965 section 3.3.4,\nrespectively) require that the ordering of pairs is \"Version, NAME, path,\ndomain\" (and, in RFC 2965, \"port\" after \"domain\"). However, HTTPClient\nproduces a cookie string with the domain pair appearing before, rather\nthan after, the path pair. The RFCs specifically *do not* use either the\ngrammar or the clarifying text (\"can occur in any order\") that occurs in\nthe sections that define the Set-Cookie and Set-Cookie2 headers (4.2.2 and\n3.2.2, respectively).\n\nSince the sections in question do not, in fact, discuss the issue of pair\nordering in Set-Cookie/Set-Cookie2 at all (other than in using a grammar\nthat clearly expresses the requirement), and since the complimentary\nheader explicitly permits them to occur in any order, it seems likely\nthat HTTPClient is not the only client with this issue, and that most\nservers will accomodate this situation (in fact, for it to have gone\nunnoticed for this long, it seems likely that either I'm badly misreading\nthe specification, or no major server has a problem coping with this).\n</debian_bugreport>\n\nFor your reference the debian bug number:\nhttp://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=329245\n\nRegards,\n\nWolfgang",
