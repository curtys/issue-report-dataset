    "description": "If you set an explicit virtual host then a getmethod may get stuck in a redirect\nloop (up to maxRedirects).\n\ne.g. execute a get on www.google.com (with a www.google.com virtualhost).  That\nredirects to www.google.co.nz (at least if you come from an NZ IP).  The current\nhttpclient behavior is to then connect to www.google.co.nz but pass through,\nwith the request, \"Host: www.google.com\".  Google will then reply with another\nwww.google.co.nz redirect and the loop continues.\n\nThere are probably a few ways to work around this.  It seems reasonable to drop\nan explicity set virtual host in the event a redirect redirects to a different\nuri authority.
