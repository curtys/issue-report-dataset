I am in the process of rewriting the auth framework in HttpClient for the 4.2 release [1]. I _will_ eventually look at your case and will try to make sure that the Kerberos authentication gets re-tried correctly on redirects. Please just bear with me. \n\nOleg\n\n[1] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HTTPCLIENT-1107",

This makes no sense as the connection has been already authenticated and HttpClient re-uses the same connection for redirected request. Am I missing something?\n\nOleg",

Consequently the client must, in every request, send authenticating information of some kind, or will get a 401. \n\nWhen the client succeeds with authentication, it gets a redirect.\n\nThen it sends a new GET to the redirect address, but as we see from the logs, it does not send any authorization information. The header\n\n  Authorization: Negotiate YIIK7gYGK...\n\nis *not* send, but I would expect this to be the case.
