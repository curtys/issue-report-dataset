This could be achieved by adding a shutdown()\nmethod as per the MultiThreadedConnectionManager.\n\nIdeally this would be added to the HttpConnection interface, but this could\nbreak existing implementations.\n\nTo avoid this, perhaps consider introducing a sub-interface with the method in it.\n\n[Could also create an AbstractConnectionManager class - this would make it\neasier to add more functions later]",
