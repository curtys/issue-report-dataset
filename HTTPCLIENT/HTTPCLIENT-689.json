The calls to HPLinker are still in the source code as comments, so you can easily locate the changes.\n\nThe next step would be to move the stack-building from the director to the client, and to drop the params attribute from the director. The director should take it's parameters from the stack that comes with the request. I'll wait with that until the first step is reviewed.\n\ncheers,\n  Roland\n",

            "body": "I've slightly revised my plan for the next step. Parameter stack building is moved to AbstractHttpClient,\nbut the DefaultClientRequestDirector keeps it's params attribute and constructor argument. Instead\nof the plain client parameters, it is initialized with the params stack created by the client.\n\nOn first glance, it seems to me that the behavior of the director becomes more predictable this way.\nIt doesn't switch between using client-only params and the params stack created for the request.\n\ncheers,\n  Roland\n",
