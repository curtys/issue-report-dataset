    "description": "The status line (typically the first line returned from a http connection read)\nis hidden inside httpclient with no way for client code to retrieve it intact.\nreadStatusLine() in HttpMethodBase is where the status line is\nread, but it is never stored and is not available outside the method.\n\nWe could store the status line as a string and add a getStatusLine\nmethod to the HttpMethod interface and HttpMethodBase class.  Alternatively, we\ncould create a header for it with the name StatusLine (or perhaps just null) so\nthat it could be retrieved with getHeader(\"StatusLine\").  This would preserve\nthe interface but would be a bit of a kludge.",
