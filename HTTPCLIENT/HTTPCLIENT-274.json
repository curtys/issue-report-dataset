    "description": "I suggest to set the ExpectContinueMethod.setUseExpectHeader per default to\nfalse or to arrange that per default it is not used. We lost an awfull lot of\ntime in a project in which we used MultipartPostMethod via a proxy. Everthing\nworked fine in dev, however as soon as we started to use the proxy in production\nor testing environment we had severe problems. We lost several manday looking\nfor the problem, including sniffing and logging op the proxy. It ended up to be\nthe useexpectheader which was true per default. Putting in on false ended our\nproblems...\n\nIn my opinion it is a bit hard to make something default behaviour if the\njavadoc warns : <snip>\nhandshake should be used with caution, as it may cause problems with HTTP\nservers and proxies that do not support HTTP/1.1 protocol.\n</snip>\n\nregards\ndirkp",
