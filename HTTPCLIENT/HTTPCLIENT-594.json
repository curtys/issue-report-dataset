No need for an emergency release if nobody is experiencing problems.\nI haven't used volatile since the times when I was programming in C and assembler,\nand I don't remember having Java threading issues because of that.\n\nStill, I'll keep it in mind and silently put some volatile declarations into HttpAsync :-)\n\ncheers,\n  Roland\n",
