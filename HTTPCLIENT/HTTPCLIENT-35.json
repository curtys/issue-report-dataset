Still all the \nWebapp tests need to be modified so that one can specify if to run them \nthrough a proxy or not.\n\nEvert: This patch contains the patch that I sent you three weeks ago, so \nthis patch will conflict with the one you supplied earlier but was only \npartly committed.\n\nI attach a patch file along with a newly added source file. Since I have \nno commit rights I can not add a file myself. I tried to keep the diff \nas clean as possible.",

            "body": "In the present version of HttpMultiClient, setting of proxies must be done at \nthe entire HttpMultiClient level, which may not be ideal requirement. An \napplication may want to use only one instance of HttpMultiClient to serve \ninternal as well as external (behind firewalls) hosts and hence setting the \nproxy on the HMC will fail to work with internal hosts. Moreover, it may be \ndesired to use a different proxy server for different host connections.  \n\nWhat could be a good solution? \n\nHaving proxy host/port setters in the UrlMethod class may not be ideal. I \nsuggest adding a proxyHost, proxyPort and useProxy (boolean) as parameters to \nthe HttpMultiClient.execute() method itself. If no proxy host and port is \nspecified and useProxy is true, the default value (set in HMC) will be used. \n\nSometimes it may also be desirable to have a support for multiple proxies. So \nif the first one is down, the second one is used, and so on. An elegant \nsolution maybe if we have a new class to handle proxy related affairs, \nincluding hand shaking, authentication, daisy chaining of proxies, and other \nproxy rules. ",
