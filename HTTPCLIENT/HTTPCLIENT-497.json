You still\nuse the public instances HEADER_WIRE and CONTENT_WIRE. Thus, it won't lead into\ncompile problems.\n\nIt is \"Logging\" API(?) change, though - but it'll produce in most cases a\n\"deprecated\" line in the logging configuration (file) only, which doesn't\n\"hurt\". I mean, when shipping a product that uses HttpClient, you normally have\nthe both lines like:\n\n  log4j.logger.org.apache.commons.httpclient WARN\n  log4j.logger.httpclient WARN\n\nThe first will take over; the second is \"ignored\" and should be replaced by:\n\n  log4j.logger.org.apache.commons.httpclient.Wire WARN\n\nCheers,\nChristian",
