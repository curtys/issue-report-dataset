    "description": "Currently, there is no way for user to set the request body in PostMethod \ndirectly. The only way to do that is by adding parameters to PostMethod. This \nmakes sense in most cases. However, there are situations that the user actually \nknows the request body and want to set it directly. adding the following method \nfixes this:\n\n    public void setRequestBody(String requestBody)\n    {\n        this.requestBody = requestBody;\n    }",
