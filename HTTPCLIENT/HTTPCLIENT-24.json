    "description": "Currently, Authenticator will throw an UnsupportedOperationException for \nunsupported authentication method (like NTLM). This is correct. However,  \nHttpMethodBase.execute only catches HttpException, so this \nUnsupportedOperationException is leaked to the user. This is undesirable, \nbecause user may want a chance to handle such such authentication themself. The \ncorrect way is to pass the http status code to the user, just like how it \ntreats redirect to a different host.\n\nThe simple fix is to catch all exceptions in HttpMethodBase.execute when \ncalling Authenticator.authenticate.",
