A new base class for test cases that need the server eases the pain of using it and setting up client-side helper objects. The test cases checked in with the server test the server itself rather than anything in HttpConn.\n\nTest coverage is still below 5% for API, 0% for impl. Some of the socket factory and scheme stuff is called in the new base class.\n\ncheers,\n  Roland\n",

There are currently no tests at all for the SCCM, and insufficient tests for the layers on top of a pool entry.",
