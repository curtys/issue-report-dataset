    "description": "This bug seems to be strongly related to #36918. But in this case, I don't have \nproxy and it is GET method.\n\nThe problem is that when a GET request with query parameters is sent to the \nserver, uri does not count in the parameters.  The server (Apache 1.3) then \nresponds with HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request. In the error log, the server writes:  \nDigest: uri mismatch - </query.cgi> does not match request-uri \n</query.cgi?format=advanced&js=1&rememberjs=1>\n\nAs far as I can tell, the problem is with the following line of code:\n------------ cut DigestScheme.java\npublic String authenticate(Credentials credentials, HttpMethod method)\n....\ngetParameters().put(\"uri\", method.getPath());\n....\n------------ cut\n\nI am inclined to quick-hack this and add method.getQueryString() to the uri; \nbut to make it right it probably needs some refactoring, esp. considering issue \n#36918.",
