I'll convert INFO logs to DEBUG prior to committing the patch\n\n> 2) The javadocs at the top of AuthSSLProtocolSocketFactory seem to have \n> some duplicated text.

Paragraph 2 deals\nwith server authentication and trust stores, whereas paragraph 4 talks about\nclient authentication and key stores. \n\nAs always I admit that my writing may leave much more to be desired. Feel free\nto make any corrections that you deem necessary to improve the javadocs\nlanguage-wise\n\nOleg",
