Then there is RFC 1867, for\nmultipart/form-data POST requests (I think I got the right number there).  Are\nthere RFCs corresponding to our \"cookie\" compliance? Any other RFCs we can claim\ncredit for conforming to?\n\nWith the recent \"Protocol\" changes, I think we've made it relatively\nstraightforward for clients of HttpClient to plug in their own secure sockets\nimplementations, making it easier to use third party, non-Sun solutions.",
