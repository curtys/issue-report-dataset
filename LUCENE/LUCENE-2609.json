It gets pushed to the maven repo by virtue of attaching it to the core jar artifact. A separate pom is not needed in this case and the tests jar can be added as a dependency using something like the following:\n\n{code}\n    <dependency>\n      <groupId>org.apache.lucene</groupId>\n      <artifactId>lucene-core</artifactId>\n      <version>${lucene.version}</version>\n      <classifier>tests</classifier>\n      <scope>test</scope>\n    </dependency>\n{code}\n\nGood point about including the -tests jar in the dist. This updated patch adds the -tests jar to the distribution. The core-javadoc and core-src, demo-javadoc and demo-src files were also not present in the distribution so I added these as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The test simply import both target lib folders and all should work. The test-base build foder is the only one jared as class files and mabe also get javadocs. The original tests are not part of this.\n\nThis would help both developers and users:\n- new developers have a set of javadoced base classes againt those they need to write their tests\n- users can reuse our cool checker/assert/... classes to check their own developments by simply adding a jar file (please, withot sources, we also dont package sources into lucene-core.jar).\n\nComments?",

We may work around that, but all tests that call new File(Class.getResource().toURI()) will of course fail (and there are lots of them).\n\nSo I prefer a small JAR file without crap that can also be shipped in the binary zip and helps the user.
