As ConstantScoreQuery does not enforce deleted documents the optimization may return wrong results (MatchAllDocs is required)\n- The API of IndexSearcher cannot be modified, so wrapFilter() is not available there. IS delegates hit collection to FilteredQuery, but it does not rewrite Filter+Query to FilteredQuery.\n\nThis is ready to commit.",

I just have one question, should we really advertise that you can pass a null Query to IndexSearcher?\n\nI heard this question quite often, how to execute a solely Filter without query. As the current API allows filter==null, why not the same for the query. Passing null as filter and query of course makes no real sense, so I don't expect this question.\n\nI think it is harder for people to explain them that they must a) either wrap the Filter with CSQ or b) must pass a MatchAllDocsQuery. If you tell them, just call IndexSearcher.search() and pass either filter, query or both, then it's much easier.",

            "body": "Here 2 patch variants:\n\n- allowNullQueryFilter.patch is the same patch as before, with some rewrite() improvements for more clarity, but it allows null Query and null Filter and so does IndexSearcher.\n- noNullQueryFilter.patch is a simplier patch, disallowing null filters and null queries, so IndexSaercher behaves as before. The only optimization is to rewrite the MatchAllDocs+Filter combination to CSQ with combined boost.\n\nAfter sleeping one night about it, I think we should start with the latter patch and maybe think about allowing a null query in IndexSearcher separately in another issue. In my opinion, the null special case should maybe done inside IS.wrapFilter. Allowing null as query or filter in FilteredQuery makes no sense and adds complexity.",

    "description": "Since the rewrite of Lucene trunk to delegate all Filter logic to FilteredQuery, by simply wrapping in IndexSearcher.wrapFilter(), we can do more short circuits and improve query execution. A common use case it to pass MatchAllDocsQuery as query to IndexSearcher and a filter. For the underlying hit collection this is stupid and slow, as MatchAllDocsQuery simply increments the docID and checks acceptDocs. If the filter is sparse, this is a big waste. This patch changes FilteredQuery.rewrite() to short circuit and return ConstantScoreQuery, if the query is MatchAllDocs.",
