TestPerfTasksParse - why do you prevent the testing of parsing of WriteLineDoc? \n>     I disabled the special handling of this and the test works as supposed.\n\nHmmm ... I was seeing a failure if I didn't do that because\nWriteLineDoc requires \"line.file.out\" Config to be set and that test\ndidn't know to do so.  I'll put it back into the test but add\n\"line.file.out\" for this task.\n\n> 2. Documentation of new properties is missing:\n>      - In CreateIndexTask: ram.flush.mb [0],  autocommit [true]\n>      - In byTask.package.html (same 2 props).\n\nOK, I'll add this and also for \"doc.term.vector.{offsets,positions}\"\nto BasicDocMaker.\n\n> 3. run.flush & aotoCommit should be added & used & documented also in openIndexTask (currently only used in createIndexTask).\n\nOK, I'll add this.\n\n> 4. AddDocTask:  flushAtRAMUsage - unused?\n\nYup, this was leftover from pre LUCENE-843 where you had to check RAM\nusage after each doc and then flush.  I'll remove it and actually just revert\nto current AddDocTask.java (I don't need any mods here).\n\n> 5. buil.xml - 1024m as default for running a benchmark seems too much?\n>     I mean, one of the nice things about Lucene is that it can run for you even if you only have few MB of RAM to spare. For someone with a low level machine, say 512M only, the JVM might fail to even start, right?\n\nWoops... I didn't mean to put this change in.  I'll leave it where it\nwas (140 MB) and remove the \"-server\" jvmarg as well.  I was hitting\nOOM on some Wikipedia algs.\n\n> 6. I like your change of factoring some of the field names into consts. We should probably do the same for the rest.\n\nOK I'll pull out the remaining ones...\n\n> 7.

This is a bit wrong(?) Usually only preparation is done in the Setup(), but real work (things we measure) should be in doLogic().  Mmm... would probably make more sense to move the file handling code from the constructor to setup(), and the doc creation code (except for docMaker extraction) from setup() to doLogic(). This should also prevent the error in TestPerfTasksParse (I think no changes would then be required in this test.) \n\nUnused imports and dateFormat in \n - LineDocMaker\n - WriteLineDocTask \n\nFor LineDocMaker, I was puzzled why you chose not to implement getNextDocData() and not base on BasicDocMaker to create the next doc for you. I now understand this is for reusing the Document and Field objects that BasicDocMaker does not support. I would add a comment on that. \n\nThe new consts in BasicDocMaker can now be used in few more places....\n",

    "description": "I've made some small improvements to the contrib/benchmark, mostly\nmerging in the ad-hoc benchmarking code I've been using in LUCENE-843:\n\n  - Fixed thread safety of DirDocMaker's usage of SimpleDateFormat\n\n  - Print the props in sorted order\n\n  - Added new config \"autocommit=true|false\" to CreateIndexTask\n\n  - Added new config \"ram.flush.mb=int\" to AddDocTask\n\n  - Added new configs \"doc.term.vector.positions=true|false\" and\n    \"doc.term.vector.offsets=true|false\" to BasicDocMaker\n\n  - Added WriteLineDocTask.java, so you can make an alg that uses this\n    to build up a single file containing one document per line in a\n    single file.  EG this alg converts the reuters-out tree into a\n    single file that has ~1000 bytes per body field, saved to\n    work/reuters.1000.txt:\n\n      docs.dir=reuters-out\n      doc.maker=org.apache.lucene.benchmark.byTask.feeds.DirDocMaker\n      line.file.out=work/reuters.1000.txt\n      doc.maker.forever=false\n      {WriteLineDoc(1000)}: *\n\n    Each line has tab-separted TITLE, DATE, BODY fields.\n\n  - Created feeds/LineDocMaker.java that creates documents read from\n    the file created by WriteLineDocTask.java.  EG this alg indexes\n    all documents created above:\n\n      analyzer=org.apache.lucene.analysis.SimpleAnalyzer\n      directory=FSDirectory\n      doc.add.log.step=500\n\n      docs.file=work/reuters.1000.txt\n      doc.maker=org.apache.lucene.benchmark.byTask.feeds.LineDocMaker\n      doc.tokenized=true\n      doc.maker.forever=false\n\n      ResetSystemErase\n      CreateIndex\n      {AddDoc}: *\n      CloseIndex\n\n      RepSumByPref AddDoc\n\nI'll attach initial patch shortly.\n",
