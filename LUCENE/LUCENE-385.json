The chance that  \nyou some day mix up index directory and document directory isn't that bad.  \nCurrently Lucene will delete *all* files in the index directory when the  \ncreate paramater passed to IndexWriter is true, thus deleting your documents \nif you mixed up the parameters. I'll attach a patch that fixes  \nthis. Any objections?",
