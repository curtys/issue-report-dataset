            "body": "Just to clarify, the specific issue here is that RuleBasedCollator (the only concrete implementation of Collator in the JDK, and the one that is always returned by Collator.getInstance(Locale)) has a synchronized compare(), meaning that if you have many threads building FieldSortedHitQueues with large results and locale-sensitive sorting, and they share a Collator, they end up waiting for each other in that method (which can obviously be called tens of thousands of times during a very large search). The way to get a Collator is by calling Collator.getInstance(Locale), which makes it look like this problem is the JDK's fault; however, Collator.getInstance(Locale) actually returns a clone() of the object from the cache. The caching mechanism seems to be to prevent having to rebuld the rule tables, rather than the objects themselves. Therefore, the JDK version balances performance and thread safety quite well. \n\nOn the Lucene end, though, the FieldSortedHitQueue implements its own caching mechanism, meaning that the generated ScoreDocComparators are cached (with no way to disable this behaviour, even if you wanted to). Therefore, one you've got your comparator (the unique key being {reader, fieldname, type, locale, factory}), every search using sorting on the same field in the same way on the same reader will use the same Collator, possibly causing a synchronization bottleneck. Even providong your own factory to the SortField doesn't REALLY help, as they're cached one level 'above' that (you can work around this; see below)\n\nAttached is a patch which provides a 'quick and dirty' way of dealing with this. NOTE: THIS PATCH IS NOT PRODUCTION QUALITY, it's just a proof of concept. If people like the idea, I'll tidy it up substantially.\n\nThis works by adding a flag, usePerThreadLocaleComparators, set by a static method, to FieldSortedHitQueue. If this flag is NOT set, behaviour remains the same. If it's set to true, however, createValue calls a per-thread version of comparatorStringLocale, which returns a simple wrapper ScoreDocComparator which delegates to the one created by comparatorStringLocale, using a ThreadLocal to make sure they're not shared between threads.\n\nFor demonstration purposes, I have added a quick demo main() method to FieldSortedHitQueue, which does a simple timing test -- 20 threads each inserting 20000 dummy documents into a 200-element FieldSortedHitQueue. Note that it uses CountDownLatches to coordinate the threads, so this dummy test will only run under Java 5. Sorry, but as a quick demo it will do for now. By changing the values of\n    final int threadCount = 20;\n    final int docCount = 10000;\n    final int queueSize = 200;\nyou can change the parameters I mentioned above. However, the figures seem to roughly the same proportion regardless of how high or low those numbers are, within reason; the parameters provided are  enough to spend a LOT of time waiting for locks; making them higher doesn't really make that much difference. If anything, making the queuesize larger makes the new version of the code (with the flag set) look better in comparison. On my dev machine (1.8 GHz Celeron laptop) the test as-is gives the following figures:\n   Shared=5219ms\n   PerThread=2140ms\nthis is a pretty substantial difference, and (I think) makes it worth pursuing this further. Your mileage may vary, but between 2x-4x faster seems typical for anywhere above, say, 5 threads, 1000 docs, and queue size of 50.\n\nSo if people are happy for me to proceed down this path, I'm equally happy to tidy up and produce a cleaner, documented etc. version of this patch. However, the more I look at this, the more I'd like to refactor this code -- it's not the nicest code in Lucene, and I think it could be tidied up (personally). My proposal would be something along the lines of changing all those static methods in FieldSortedHitQueue (comparatorXXXX) to be implementations of SortComparatorSource. There'd be a StringComparatorSource, AutoComparatorSource, etc. Everything in FSHQ would be made to deal with the SortComparatorSources only, abstracting out all the hard work. The logic of the create() method  could be replaced by a PerFieldComparatorSource, which produces one or more of the others depending on the field type, much as it does now. Everything else could be implemented (possibly) using the Decorator pattern to implement new SortComparatorSources. Namely, a CachingComparatorSource would use some sort of caching mechanism (possibly the FieldCacheImpl.Cache, as it does now, though that seems like an odd coupling) to cache the SortComparatorSources produced by the PerFieldComparatorSource; then we're basically back where we are now. Along comes the PerThreadComparatorSource, which uses ThreadLocals to do basically what my patch above does. All these classes would be available externally, for people to wrap around their own SortComparatorSources when setting up their SortFields; if no factory is provided in the SortField, things work much as they do now.\n\nWhat do people think? Is the quick and dirty way (a) worthwhile, and (b) good enough? Should I look at implementing the bigger, fancier patch which will be more work and more complicated but ultimately (I think) make FieldSortedHitQueues much cleaner? Or is there another alternative (for example, another low-impact option would be doing something like what  I've done now, but instead using a ThreadLocal in a Comparator implementation, which could mean that the API for FieldSortedHitQueue doesn't need to change at all). Or is this not worth making part of the source tree, given that there are ways around it (supplying your own SortComparatorSource which manages its own ThreadLocals).  The performance gain IS substantial, though...\n\nApologies for length, this is quite a confusing area and I wanted to make sure I hadn't forgotten anything.",

            "body": "Hi all,\n\nAttached is a patch which BEGINS to address (but by no means completes) the refactoring proposal I mentioned earlier. That is, it works towards removing the logic in FieldSortedHitQueue, replacing all of the comparatorXXX() methods with individual implementations of SortComparatorSource. This lets me work towards the next step, replacing the logic in the FieldCacheImpl.Cache { createValue() } with another SCS, using some sort of 'pluggable' mechanism rather than just creating new SCSes on the fly.\n\nAttached primarily for review/discussion, as there's a lot more to do.",

I didn't follow everything you said, but it sounds like a lot of internal shuffling.  Perhaps, to address just the performance, you can just go with adding ThreadLocal RuleBasedCollators in FSHQ and do the other changes in a separate issue and patch, if people think this would be an improvement.\n",

            "body": "Otis, you're probably right -- it may not be wise to tackle two birds with one stone. My concern is that if I do this a quick and dirty way, it may involve exposing an API to enable/disable this behaviour which a subsequent refactor would then remove, and I'd obviously rather keep the API stable.\n\nI'm about to attach 3 patches, with varying levels of effect on the code. I'd be interested to see what people think is the best approach given the possible refactor.\n\nHoss, I've had a look at your patch, and rather like it. That's kind of tackling a slightly different problem; that's cleaning up the FieldCache (which is a great idea) whereas cleaning up FSHQ is only incidentally related to FieldCache. It uses it (and if it was broken up, each comparator source would be using your much cleaner API) but I think the two coexist quite happily. I'd like to see both, in other words!",

I don't think this problem is the root cause of our performance problem, but I thought I'd mention it here.  Here's the stack dump of a thread waiting:\n\n\"http-1001-Processor245\" daemon prio=1 tid=0x31434da0 nid=0x3744 waiting for monitor entry [0x2cd44000..0x2cd45f30]\n        at java.text.RuleBasedCollator.compare(RuleBasedCollator.java)\n        - waiting to lock <0x6b1e8c68> (a java.text.RuleBasedCollator)\n        at org.apache.lucene.search.FieldSortedHitQueue$4.compare(FieldSortedHitQueue.java:320)\n        at org.apache.lucene.search.FieldSortedHitQueue.lessThan(FieldSortedHitQueue.java:114)\n        at org.apache.lucene.util.PriorityQueue.upHeap(PriorityQueue.java:120)\n        at org.apache.lucene.util.PriorityQueue.put(PriorityQueue.java:47)\n        at org.apache.lucene.util.PriorityQueue.insert(PriorityQueue.java:58)\n        at org.apache.lucene.search.FieldSortedHitQueue.insert(FieldSortedHitQueue.java:90)\n        at org.apache.lucene.search.FieldSortedHitQueue.insert(FieldSortedHitQueue.java:97)\n        at org.apache.lucene.search.TopFieldDocCollector.collect(TopFieldDocCollector.java:47)\n        at org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanScorer2.score(BooleanScorer2.java:291)\n        at org.apache.lucene.search.IndexSearcher.search(IndexSearcher.java:132)\n        at org.apache.lucene.search.IndexSearcher.search(IndexSearcher.java:110)\n        at com.aconex.index.search.FastLocaleSortIndexSearcher.search(FastLocaleSortIndexSearcher.java:90)\n.....\n\nIn our case we had 12 threads waiting like this, while one thread had the lock on the RuleBasedCollator.  Turns out RuleBasedCollator's.compare(...) method is synchronized.  I wonder if a ThreadLocal based collator would be better here... ?  There doesn't appear to be a reason for other threads searching the same index to wait on this sort.  Be just as easy to use their own.  (Is RuleBasedCollator a \"heavy\" object memory wise?  Wouldn't have thought so, per thread)\n\nThoughts?\n\n---\n\nI've investigated this somewhat, and agree that this is a potential problem with a series of possible workarounds.
