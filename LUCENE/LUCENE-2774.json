Apparently Ant 1.8.X no longer pays attention to jars in {{$ANT_HOME/lib/}}?)\n\nHowever, after applying your patch, the build still fails on trunk (haven't tried branch_3x yet), though not with the same failure.\n\n(Ant 1.7.0, Sun JDK 1.6.0_13 on Cygwin/WinVista):\n\n{noformat}\nBUILD FAILED\nC:\\cygwin\\home\\us\\svn\\lucene\\dev\\trunk\\lucene\\build.xml:396: The following error occurred while executing this line:\nC:\\cygwin\\home\\us\\svn\\lucene\\dev\\trunk\\lucene\\common-build.xml:324: Error deploying artifact 'org.apache.lucene:lucene-core:jar': Error deploying artifact: \nFile C:\\cygwin\\home\\us\\svn\\lucene\\dev\\trunk\\lucene\\build\\${project.artifactId}-${project.version}.jar does not exist\n{noformat}\n\nLooks like some kind of failed interpolation maybe?\n\nI'm going to try under Linux later today.",

Use Ant 1.7.x\n- Both Lucene 3.x and trunk build correctly without your patch, as it can be seen every night on Hudson.\n- There are some warnings and errors about missing artifacts, but the JARs are built correctly - so not fatal - that was always the case and we dont want to touch this :-)\n- Building maven artifacts from inside contrib dirs do not work, only from top-level lucene subdir\n- Building maven artifacts from the lucene/solr main folder does not work, too (I mean directly below trunk or branch_3x) -> be sure to be inside lucene folder\n\nSee hudson builds:\n- https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/Lucene-trunk/1369/consoleText\n- https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/Lucene-3.x/187/consoleText\n\nMaybe your maven.jar version is wrong, we are using 2.0.9 on hudson.

(I put maven-ant-tasks-2.0.9.jar in {{C:\\Users\\sarowe\\.ant\\lib\\}}, rather than the Cygwin-ish {{/home/sarowe/.ant/lib}}, because Ant is running on the native Windows binary 1.6.0_21 JRE).\n\n",

Its unclear from the comments whether this patch does\nthat (it might, but i don't know, since we have no way of verifying that maven is working).\n",

Since these changes, the only full build that has completed is the Lucene-3.x build, and it was a success.\n\nI'll leave this issue open until all of the nightly Hudson builds have succeeded (hopefully that will happen tonight).",
