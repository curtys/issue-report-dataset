            "body": "Attaching patch (lucene-threadlocal.patch) which serves as an example for how the previous patch might be built-upon to provide improvements or pluggable functionality. This is a fix for LUCENE-806 (the need to use ThreadLocal Comparators for sorting performance); it provides a replacement implementation of StringComparatorSource. Enabling this functionality would be as simple as:\n  FieldSortedHitQueue.registerComparatorSource(SortField.STRING, new ThreadLocalStringComparatorSource());\nand the new behaviour would kick in, relatively seamlessly.\n\nNote that this patch includes a new version of StringComparatorSource, which replaces the one from the previous patch.\n\nI will attach this to LUCENE-806 as well for discussion on that end.",

    "description": "Per the discussion (quite some time ago) on issue LUCENE-806, I'd like to propose an architecture change to the way FieldSortedHitQueue works, and in particular the way it creates SortComparatorSources. I think (I hope) that anyone who looks at the FSHQ code will agree that the class does a lot and much of it's repetitive stuff that really has no business being in that class.\n\nI am about to attach a patch which, in and of itself, doesn't really achieve much that's concrete but does tidy things up a great deal and makes it easier to plug in different behaviours. I then have a subsequent patch which provides a fairly simple and flexible example of how you might replace an implementation, in this case the field-local-String-comparator version from LUCENE-806.\n\nThe downside to this patch is that it involved changing the signature of SortComparatorSource.newComparator to take a Locale. There would be ways around this (letting FieldSortedHitQueue take in either a SortComparatorSource or some new, improved interface which takes a Locale (and possibly extends SortComparatorSource). I'm open to this but personally I think that the Locale version makes sense and would suggest that the code would be nicer by breaking the API (and hence targeting this to, presumably, 3.0 at a minimum).\n\nThis code does not include specific tests (I will add these, if people like the general idea I'm proposing here) but all current tests pass with this change.\n\nPatch to follow.",
