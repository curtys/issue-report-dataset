I wonder if we should use GetResourcesAsStream rather than the system property. the resources should always be on the classpath. \n\nI don't think we should, because otherwise the test becomes complicated.\nThis test reads thru voc.txt sequentially and for each line in the file, verifies the expected output against the same line in output.txt\nWith ZipFile it does buffering and such transparently to make this very simple.\n\nWith ZipInputStream i would have to do this myself.\n",
