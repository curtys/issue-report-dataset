    "description": "Spinoff from here:\n\n    http://www.nabble.com/Runtime-exception-when-creating-IndexSearcher-to20226279.html\n\nIf you open an IndexSearcher/Reader, passing in String or File, then\ncloseDirectory is set to true in the reader.\n\nIf the index has a single segment, then SegmentReader.get is used to\nopen the index.  If an IOException is hit in there, the SegmentReader\ncloses itself and then closes the directory since closeDirectory is\ntrue.\n\nThe problem is, the retry logic in SegmentInfos (to look for another\nsegments_N to try) kicks in and hits an AlreadyClosedException,\nmasking the original root cause.\n\nWorkaround is to separately get the Directory using\nFSDirectory.getDirectory, and then instantiate IndexSearcher/Reader\nfrom that.\n\nThis manifests as masking the root cause of a corrupted single-segment\nindex with a confusing AlreadyClosedException.  You could also hit\nthe false exception if the writer was in the process of committing\n(ie, a retry was really needed) or if there is some transient IO\nproblem opening the index (eg too many open files).\n",
