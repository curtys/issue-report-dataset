Thats pretty natural man, normal for people to disagree on opinions.\nbecause I don't see that you are going away from your opinion whatever I say. You made clear you don't want to have any builder pattern in lucene so what is the point of discussing then. I need to put up my own patch which uses the builder to make my objections being in the patch obviously which is not what I am used to. Usually we try to find a compromise and by iterating, right? Each time this pattern comes up there is no way that you move a tiny bit from your opinion just because you don't like it. Well I don't like things people suggest from a code syte perspective but it makes sense very often, so I change it. I don't see why this needs to go for rounds and rounds of fighting here. We did this for a reason when ScorerContext has introduced, it served as a little DSL on top of it enforcing immutability. if you want to have Bit mandatory you should just do something like ScorereContext.create(delDocs).topLevel(true).outOfOrder(false) which makes very clear what you want rather than new ScoreContext(delDocs, true, false) and we gonna have more boolean params here in the future.",

In this case LUCENE-1536 is\nan enormous performance gain.\n\nNet/net I don't like the use of the builder pattern for ScorerContext.\nIt seems like overkill: we only have 3 settings here.  Even by the\nproponents of the builder pattern this is overkill?\n\nI think chained setters are less readable (see LUCENE-2308).\n\nI do agree 2 booleans in a row is asking for sneaky trouble; we can\nadd .setX instead (these fields need not be final)?  Or the int flags\nto the ctor is a great solution too (I think we should do this for\nFieldType as well).\n\nNet/net plain old boring java object would work fine here.\n\nAnd, in general, I don't think we should let the builder pattern seep\ninto Lucene, for the simple reason that it's obviously controversial.\nThis is no different from any other controversial change in\nopen-source...\n\nAlso, one can always make a shim layer on top of Lucene that exposes\nbuilder APis for everything?  QueryParser, *Query, *Field/Document,\nIR, IW, merge policies/schedulers, etc., all could be cutover to\nbuilder APIs \"up above\" right?

            "body": "\nbq. I don't like the idea of shying away from a change just because it's controversial. Sometimes its necessary to shake things up with new ideas.\n\n+1 I'm all for pushing new ideas that make good, hard improvements to\nLucene (like LUCENE-1536).\n\nbq. you seem to be asking for those who advocate a builder like API here to compromise and for those who don't want such an API, to not? Thats a tough pill to swallow.\n\nI am in fact asking for that, because largely Lucene does not adopt\nthe builder pattern today, the builder pattern is relatively new and\ntrendy, vs Lucene's codebase, and now we see it seeping in, in various\nplaces/patches/etc.  Not only is it new, it's also controversial\namongst the committers.\n\nI think it's also reasonable because you can naturally layer the\nbuilder API on top of a simple java APIs, but not really vice/versa.\nOne could create a very nice shim \"Lucene builder APIs\" library.\nIt need not be in our core APIs.\n\nThis way apps that love the builder pattern can use the builder shim;\nthose that don't like them can use the plain java APIs.\n\nAs other \"popular\" patterns try to seep into Lucene, I think we should\nalso take a cautious stance: we should not apply a pattern just\nbecause it exists and has become popular; we should see strong\ntechnical benefits to Lucene before doing so.\n\nSo, stepping back, \"adopting the builder pattern in Lucene's APIs\" is\nthe overall change I'm talking about, and I think that is a big\nchange.\n\nbq. Also, this API feels to me to be a lot more internal, so whether or not builders could be built on top of more outward facing concepts like QueryParsers, Field/Document etc, seems a different issue?\n\nRight this is an internal API, but for example if you build custom\nqueries/scorers you can still use a builder shim on top of Lucene's\ncore ScorerContext.  It could be part of this builder shim library\ntoo.\n\nReally \"Lucene should adopt the builder pattern\" to me is a big\nchange, and it's a codebase-wide, global decision.  It's actually very\nsimilar to passionate disagreements on whitespace, and this is why we\n(thankfully) have a hard standard on what our whitespace looks like.\nOtherwise we'd be having huge arguments about whether parens should be\nsurrounded by whitespace on every patch.\n\nSo net/net I don't think Lucene should adopt the builder pattern, for\ninternal or external APIs.  Just build a shim library on top.\n",

I dont think having 2 booleans counts as 'building', and I().dont().want().lucenes().code().to().read().like().this() ... i think chaining only makes sense in certain cases like StringBuilder, but *NOT* for building an FST for example.\n* The builders i mentioned don't create objects on every add() or set(), and they aren't going to be in anyone's tight loop, so I think they make perfect sense.\n\nSo really my opinion on Builders is no different than my opinion on ArrayList: you use them when its the appropriate solution and when it makes sense... I think thats when you are actually building stuff.\n",
