            "body": "First pass at a patch on providing a callback mechanism for term vectors.  The big benefit to this is the ability to control how to store the TV info, instead of being stuck with parallel arrays.  Two sample implementations are provided, as FieldSortedTermVectorMapper and SortedTermVectorMapper.\n\nOne thing I am not completely sure on and would appreciate a review of, is the interface definition of TermVectorMapper, in particular the interplay of the setExpectations method with the actual map method (see the TermVectorsReader).  It is not thread-safe (although I am not so sure the current way is either)\n\nThe existing access methods for TVs still works just the same, even though the underlying implementation is different.  \n\nI don't know if this is any faster in the Lucene core, but it should speed up those applications that have to reformat the TV info for their needs.\n\n",

            "body": "I haven't really used the term vector APIs, but I like the goal of allowing the app to handle things.\nWhat about dropping down a level lower, and not constructing the arrays or TermVectorOffsetInfo either?\nPerhaps something like:\n\npublic interface TermVectorMapper {\n  void setExpectations(String field, int numTerms, boolean hasOffsets, boolean hasPositions);\n  void mapTerm(String term, int frequency)\n  void mapTermPos(int startOffset, int endOffset, int position)\n}\n\nOne could have an implementation of TermVectorMapper that collected the offsets and positions into an array as your patch does now.  I'm not sure if there would be a noticable performance impact to a method call per term instance or not.\n\nOh, wait...  I just went and looked at the readTermVector() code, and positions and offsets aren't stored interleaved, so one would have to do a sequence of mapTermPos() followed by a sequence of mapTerm Offset(), which makes less sense than what you have now.\n\nMight also consider using an abstract class instead of an interface in case you want to make backward-compatible tweaks later.",

I also agree with Yonik about the array[]s constructed and passed down to the mapper. Perhaps your current implementation could be moved one layer further up? Another thought is to reuse array(s) and pass on the data length, but that might just complicate things.\n\nI'll try to introduce these things next week and see how well it works. \n\nI use the term vectors for text classification. For each new classifier introduced (occurs quite a lot) I iterate the corpus and classify the documents. Potentially it could save me quite a bit of ticks and bits to not create all them array[]s, however my gut tells me there might be some JVM settings that does the same trick. I'll have to look in to that.\n\n",

This way a mapper could express whether it wants these arrays to be constructed even if they are turned on.  Then we just need to skip ahead by the appropriate amount.\n",
