I also removed _TestIgnoredException in favor of a subclass of AssumptionIgnoredException - this removes some conditional checks and unwinding code.\n\nI added some tests to detect the expected behavior of LTC (what Robert mentioned); I would feel great if we check that all the expectations are covered before we commit this in -- if you can post a simple class along with: \"this should result in this and that\" I'll update the tests. There are examples of such expectations in the patch (static classes and tests inside TestSetupTeardownMethods class).",

I suggest we move forward and upgrade to JUnit 4.10 which provides several infrastructural changes (serializable Description objects, class-level rules, various tweaks). JUnit 4.10 also changes (or fixes, depends how you look at it) the order in which @Before/@After hooks and @Rules are applied. This makes the old state-machine in LuceneTestCase fail (because the order is changed).\n\nI rewrote the state machine and used a different, I think simpler, although Uwe may disagree :), mechanism in which the hook methods setUp/ tearDown are still there, but they are empty at the top level and serve only to detect whether subclasses chain super.setUp/tearDown properly (if they override anything).\n\nIn the long term, I would love to just get rid of public setup/teardown methods and make them private (so that they cannot be overriden or even seen by subclasses) but this will require changes to the runner itself.",
