All the primitive/ primitive array methods are fine, but why make things inconsistent with sizeOf(String)? I'd rather have the reflection-based method estimate the size of a String/String[]. Like we mentioned it's always a matter of speed/accuracy but here I'd opt for accuracy because the output can be off by a lot if you make substrings along the way (not to mention it assumes details about String internal implementation which may or may not be true, depending on the vendor).\n\nDo you have a need for this method, Shai?

The difference in sizes of 'orig' stem from AverageGuessMemoryModel which computes the reference size to be 4 (hardcoded), and array size to be 16 (hardcoded). I modified AverageGuess to use constants from RUE (they are best guesses themselves). Still the test prints a difference, but now I think it's because sizeOf(String) aligns the size to mod 8, while estimateRamUsage isn't. I fixed that in size(Object), and now the prints are the same.\n\n* I also fixed sizeOfArray -- if the array.length == 0, it returned 0, but it should return its header, and aligned to mod 8 as well.\n\n* I modified sizeOf(String[]) to sizeOf(Object[]) and compute its raw size only. I started to add sizeOf(String), fastSizeOf(String) and deepSizeOf(String[]), but reverted to avoid the hassle -- the documentation confuses even me :).\n\n* Changed all sizeOf() to return long, and align() to take and return long.\n\nI think this is ready to commit, though I'd appreciate a second look on the MemoryModel and size(Obj) changes.\n\nAlso, how about renaming MemoryModel methods to: arrayHeaderSize(), classHeaderSize(), objReferenceSize() to make them more clear and accurate? For instance, getArraySize does not return the size of an array, but its object header ...",

The trick to get the object header from usafe is by declaring a dummy class extending Object with one single field. We are then using unsafe to get the fieldOffset of that field. As Dawid pointed out, the return value is identical to his investigations (8 bytes on 32 bit archs, 16 bytes on 64 bit archs and 12 bytes on compact ref 64bit archs).

The answer seems to be in how base offsets are calculated for arrays -- they seem to be enforced on HeapWordSize boundary and this is 8, even with OOP compressed:\n{noformat}\n  // Returns the offset of the first element.\n  static int base_offset_in_bytes(BasicType type) {\n    return header_size(type) * HeapWordSize;\n  }\n{noformat}\nI'll spare you the detailed code but the rounding to next HeapWordSize multiple seems evident in all cases. What's even more interesting, this \"wasted\" space is not (and cannot) be used for data so even a single integer pushes the array size to the next available bound:\n{noformat}\nint[0] = 24\nint[1] = 32   (*)\nint[2] = 32\nint[3] = 40\n{noformat}\n\nFinally, I could not resist to mention that object alignments... are adjustable, at least to 2^n boundaries. So you can also do this:\n{noformat}\n> java  -XX:-UseCompressedOops -XX:ObjectAlignmentInBytes=32 ...\nObject = 32\nint[0] = 32\nint[1] = 32\nint[2] = 32\nint[3] = 64\n{noformat}\nNice, huh? :) I don't think the JVM has been tested heavily for this possibility though because the code hung on me a few times if executed in that mode.",

It's not easy because RUE itself allocates memory (and not small quantities in case of complex object graphs!). I left these experiments in StressRamUsageEstimator; it is a test case -- maybe we should add @Ignore and rename it to Test*, don't know.\n\nAnyway, the allocation seems to be measured pretty accurately. When tlabs are disabled this is a result of allocating small byte arrays for example:\n{noformat}\n committed           max        estimated(allocation)\n      2 MB\t   48.4 MB\t  16 bytes\n    1.7 MB\t   48.4 MB\t  262.4 KB\n      2 MB\t   48.4 MB\t  524.6 KB\n    2.2 MB\t   48.4 MB\t    787 KB\n    2.5 MB\t   48.4 MB\t      1 MB\n    2.7 MB\t   48.4 MB\t    1.3 MB\n      3 MB\t   48.4 MB\t    1.5 MB\n    3.3 MB\t   48.4 MB\t    1.8 MB\n....\n   46.9 MB\t   48.4 MB\t   45.6 MB\n   47.1 MB\t   48.4 MB\t   45.9 MB\n   47.4 MB\t   48.4 MB\t   46.1 MB\n   47.6 MB\t   48.4 MB\t   46.4 MB\n   47.9 MB\t   48.4 MB\t   46.6 MB\n   48.1 MB\t   48.4 MB\t   46.9 MB\n{noformat}\n\nSo it's fairly ideal (committed memory is all committed memory so I assume additional data structures, classes, etc. also count in).\n\nUnfortunately it's not always so smooth, for example jrockit's mx beans seem not to return the actual memory allocation state (and if they do, I don't understand it):\n{noformat}\n committed           max        estimated(allocation)\n   29.4 MB\t     50 MB\t  16 bytes\n   29.8 MB\t     50 MB\t  262.5 KB\n   30.2 MB\t     50 MB\t  524.9 KB\n   30.4 MB\t     50 MB\t  787.3 KB\n   30.8 MB\t     50 MB\t      1 MB\n   31.1 MB\t     50 MB\t    1.3 MB\n   31.4 MB\t     50 MB\t    1.5 MB\n   31.7 MB\t     50 MB\t    1.8 MB\n     32 MB\t     50 MB\t      2 MB\n   32.4 MB\t     50 MB\t    2.3 MB\n   32.7 MB\t     50 MB\t    2.6 MB\n   33.1 MB\t     50 MB\t    2.8 MB\n   33.5 MB\t     50 MB\t    3.1 MB\n   33.8 MB\t     50 MB\t    3.3 MB\n   34.2 MB\t     50 MB\t    3.6 MB\n   34.5 MB\t     50 MB\t    3.8 MB\n   34.8 MB\t     50 MB\t    4.1 MB\n   35.2 MB\t     50 MB\t    4.4 MB\n   35.5 MB\t     50 MB\t    4.6 MB\n   35.7 MB\t     50 MB\t    4.9 MB\n   36.2 MB\t     50 MB\t    5.1 MB\n   36.4 MB\t     50 MB\t    5.4 MB\n...\n   49.6 MB\t     50 MB\t   47.6 MB\n     50 MB\t     50 MB\t   47.9 MB\n   49.6 MB\t     50 MB\t   48.2 MB\n   49.9 MB\t     50 MB\t   48.4 MB\n{noformat}\n\nA snapshot from 32 bit HotSpot:\n{noformat}\n...\n   25.5 MB\t   48.4 MB\t   24.7 MB\n   25.7 MB\t   48.4 MB\t   24.9 MB\n   25.9 MB\t   48.4 MB\t   25.1 MB\n   26.1 MB\t   48.4 MB\t   25.3 MB\n   26.3 MB\t   48.4 MB\t   25.5 MB\n   26.5 MB\t   48.4 MB\t   25.7 MB\n   26.7 MB\t   48.4 MB\t   25.9 MB\n   26.8 MB\t   48.4 MB\t   26.1 MB\n     27 MB\t   48.4 MB\t   26.4 MB\n   27.2 MB\t   48.4 MB\t   26.6 MB\n   27.4 MB\t   48.4 MB\t   26.8 MB\n   27.7 MB\t   48.4 MB\t     27 MB\n...\n{noformat}\n\nI see two problems that remain, but I don't think they're urgent enough to be addressed now:\n- the stack easily overflows if the graph of objects has long chains. This is demonstrated in the test case (uncomment ignore annotation).\n- there is a fair amount of memory allocation going on in the RUE itself. If one _knows_ the graph of an object's dependencies is a tree then the memory cost could be decreased to zero (because we wouldn't need to remember which objects we've seen so far).\n- we could make RUE an object again (resign from static methods) and have a cache of classes and class-fields to avoid reflective accesses over and over. If one performed estimations over and over then such a  RUE instance would have an initial cost, but then would be running smoother.\n\nHaving said that, I'm +1 for committing this in if you agree with the changes I've made (I will be a pain in the arse about that naming convention discriminating between shallow vs. deep sizeOf though :).",

            "body": "Thanks for the insight.\n\nWhen thinking about the reordering, I am a littel bit afraid about the \"optimization\" in the shallow sizeOf(Class<?>). This optimiaztion does not recurse to superclasses, as it assumes, that all field offsets are greater than those of the superclass, so finding the maximum does not need to recurse up (so it early exits).\n\nThis is generally true (also in the above printout), but not guaranteed. E.g. JRockit does it partly (it reuses space inside the superclass area to locate the byte from the subclass). In the above example still the order of fields is always Super-Sub-SubSub, but if the ordeing in the JRockit example would be like:\n\n{noformat}\n@ 8  1 Super.superByte\n@ 9  7 Sub.subByte\n@16  8 Super.subLong\n@24  8 Sub.subLong\n@32  8 SubSub.subSubLong\n@40  8 SubSub.subSubByte\n@48    sizeOf(SubSub.class instance)\n{noformat}\n\nThe only thing the JVM cannot change is field offsets between sub classes (so the field offset of the superclass is inherited), but it could happen that *new* fields are located between super's fields (see above - it's unused space). This would also allow casting and so on (it's unused space in superclass). Unfortunately with that reordering the maximum field offset in the subclass is no longer guaranteed to be greater.\n\nI would suggest that we remove the \"optimization\" in the shallow class size method. It's too risky in my opinion to underdetermine the size, because the maximum offset in the subclass is < the maximum offset in the superclass.\n\nI hope my explanation was understandable... :-)\n\nDawid, what do you thing, should we remove the \"optimization\"? Patch is easy.",
