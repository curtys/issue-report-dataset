If indeed having everything \"in one bucket\" is too slow, we could combine the two approaches: still use buckets, but within each bucket we have a wFST (ie, use the \"true\" score), so we don't actually do any quantizing in the end results.  Then bucketing is purely an optimization...\n\nOr, maybe, we could keep one bucket but sort each node's arcs by their output instead of by label.  This'd mean the initial lookup-by-prefix gets slower (linear scan instead a bin search, assuming those nodes had array'd arcs), but then producing the top-N is very fast (no wasted arcs need to be scanned).  Maybe we could keep the by-label sort for nodes within depth N, and then sort by output beyond that...\n\nOr we could change the outputs algebra so that more \"lookahead\" is stored in each output so we have more guidance on which arcs are worth pursuing...\n",

I don't know how you planned to go around selecting top-N, but in my understanding (at that moment) top-N selection is not going to work via recursive scan because an output at the given level doesn't tell you much about which arcs to follow. \n\nI can see how this can be solved by picking the arc/direction with the \"next smallest/largest\" output among all arcs traversed so far but this will be more complex and I cannot provide any bounds on how large the queue can be or what the   worst case lookup then is. I do have a feeling a degenerate example can be devised, but then I also have a feeling these are uncommon in practice.\n\nSorting arcs by score doesn't help if you use the pq -- you need to add all of them to the pq and then pick the smallest path. In a way it is like what you did, but the pq is maintaining fast access to the next-smaller-cost path. Another feeling is that the PQ can be bound to a maximum size of N? Every arc leads to at least one leaf so while traversing you'd drop those arcs that definitely would have fallen out of the first N smallest/largest weights... Yes, this could work. I'd still try to devise a degenerate example to see what the cost of maintaining the PQ can be.",

I fixed the random test to randomly pick a topN and it's passing!\n\nI think the cost is something like O(N * L) + O(N * log(N)), where N is the top N and L is the length of each completion.  The N * log(N) is because I use a TreeSet (PQ wasn't enough: I needed pollFirst and pollLast... for 3.x that'll have to be 2 method calls...)... but I suspect in practice it won't dominate, since N is typically smaller than L and the constant in front of that is tiny...\n\nEach path requires a traversal through the FST looking for the arcs with NO_OUTPUT, so if the FST has many non-competitive arcs that will definitely slow it down (by a [possibly large] constant factor).  We need to test on a real data set how slow it is....\n",

Because, those two arc.labels you use aren't necessarily \"comparable\", since the two paths may not be the same length (hmm or share the same \"last parent\" node)?  You need to roll back and do a full compare of the accumulated input labels down that path?  I struggled with this too...\n\nI also took advantage of a neat property that every min/+ wFST will have (Robert pointed this out): the first arc (only) will have the min output, and then there must exist a NO_OUTPUT completion path from that arc to some final node.  So, I think my patch will visit paths in the same best-first order as yours, but I avoid the push/pop/new object into the queue for each arc traversed by greedily/recursively pursuing the first NO_OUTPUT arc I can find.  I only fall back to the queue when I need to find the next top-N path to pursue...\n\n",

This patch uses Integer precision and is only 10% larger\nthan the previous impl.\n\nWe don't even need precision to be configurable really,\nwe could wire it to integers as a start. But maybe later someone could specify it, e.g.\nif they specified 8 then they basically get the same result as bucketed algorithm today...\n",

    "description": "Currently the FST suggester (really an FSA) quantizes weights into buckets (e.g. single byte) and puts them in front of the word.\nThis makes it fast, but you lose granularity in your suggestions.\n\nLately the question was raised, if you build lucene's FST with positiveintoutputs, does it behave the same as a tropical semiring wFST?\n\nIn other words, after completing the word, we instead traverse min(output) at each node to find the 'shortest path' to the \nbest suggestion (with the highest score).\n\nThis means we wouldnt need to quantize weights at all and it might make some operations (e.g. adding fuzzy matching etc) a lot easier.",
