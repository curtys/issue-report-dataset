            "body": "Hi,\n\nI am considering doing a gsoc proposal about this, any specific points I should be covering on the proposal?\n\nI saw Adriano's comment on another LUCENE-1823:\n\n{quote}\nThe map idea is really good and fits well as configuration for the QP, but I would like to restrict the key type, so the user doesn't use a String object as key. String keys may lead to runtime errors, mainly when they are inserted inline. I would prefer to use enums as keys, it would enforce the user to always pass the same object as key when referencing the same configuration. It also avoids duplicated configuration keys, once each enum type has only one instance per JVM.\n\nIf nobody complains about using a Map<Enum<?>, Object> as configuration for QP framework, I will start working on a new patch including these changes soon.\n{quote}\n\nI will try to initially cover how we can use Map to replace the current config API. Also I would like to cover how/whether we can make the new API compatible with the old one, so users can migrate from old to new slowly, deprecating the old one of course. I will also investigate the best way to enforce the user to always pass the same key object. Also try to suggest an API that will allow the users to retrieve the config values without casting them from Object, maybe Java generic capability will enable it, but I am not sure it will work with Enum.\n\nAnything else I should be covering on the proposal?",

            "body": "Here are my initial thoughts:\n\nThere will be two types of config classes, as there is today, one for global configuration and other for field configuration. The global config class will hold reference to the field configurations. The field configuration will have the field name. They both will extend a common class, which is some kind of map.\n\nThe key will be an special type (ConfigKey). This ConfigKey class will be final and will receive a generic argument when constructed. The user will need to define it and always use the same constants. To make sure the user uses it correctly, we can enforce ConfigKey.equals to only return true when the same instance is passed to equals method, so the map will only return the object for that key when the defined key is used. Example:\n\n{quote}\n// developer code\nfinal public static ConfigKey<String> MY_CONFIG_KEY = new ConfigKey<String>();\n...\nString myConfig = getConfig().get(MY_CONFIG_KEY);\n/////////////////\n// user code\ngetConfig().set(MY_CONFIG_KEY, \"value1\"); // works\ngetConfig().set(new ConfigKey<String>(), \"value1\"); // does not work, as the developer's code will look up for the key the developer has previously defined, any other instance passed as key won't be found when the developer's code is executed\n{quote}\n\nI couldn't find a way to do the generic capability above with Enum. Actually, I don't see any reason to use Enum in this case.\n\nThoughts?\n",

It seems your patch references many times the constants in StandardQueryConfigHandler.ConfigurationKeys using @see tag, unfortunately you forgot to create a javadoc for those constants and it's causing the ant script to fail. Please, add these missing javadocs, run ant javadocs on contrib/queryparser to check if it finishes successfully and then submit a new patch.\n\nBesides that, great job, tests are running fine even after your big change :)\n\nThanks!",
