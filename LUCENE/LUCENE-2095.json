If you only allow 1 thread into commit at a time I believe the issue won't happen.\n\nIt has to do with what thread #2 does when it enters commit and thread #1 is already in the process of committing.  In this case thread #2 basically waits for thread #1 to finish and then returns, whereas it should start its own new commit.",

            "body": "Why do we allow un-synchronized commit if doFlush is\nsynchronized? The main cost of commit is most likely in the\nflush as it doesn't wait for merges? There's a todo above\ndoFlush indicating we may want to make it un-synchronized in the\nfuture to not block merges, how tenable is this?",

            "body": "I think the main cost is often fsync'ing the new files.\n\nBut I agree we should simply lock so only one thread can be in commit\nat once.  Concurrency inside commit (when fscyning) seems silly (it\nused to be slightly more interesting when we had autoCommit=true).\n\nWe shouldn't use IW's lock.  First, it's overkill (doing so would\nunnecessarily block other sync'd ops from running).  Second, it leads\nto deadlock, at least in CMS (if it waits because too many merges are\nrunning).  I'll use a separate lock.\n\nI'm not adding locking around the separate calls to prepareCommit then\ncommit.  An app must ensure these two calls are always balanced.\n\nMaking flush unsynchronized would be great but I think wouldn't be\nthat big a gain in practice, unless we could make it truly unsync'd\neven with adding new docs.  Ie, if while we are flushing the last\nsegment, we can accept adding/deleting docs into a new ram buffer in\nDW, that'd be quite interesting.  But that's a big change!\n",
