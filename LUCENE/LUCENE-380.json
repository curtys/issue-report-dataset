    "description": "I would like to contribute a greek analyzer for lucene. It is based on the\nexisting Russian analyzer and features:\n\n- most common greek character sets, such as Unicode, ISO-8859-7 and Windows-1253\n- a collection of common greek stop words\n- conversion of characters with diacritics (accent, diaeresis) in the lower case\nfilter, as well as handling of special characters, such as small final sigma\n\nFor the character sets I used RFC 1947 (Greek Character Encoding for Electronic\nMail Messages) as a reference. I have incorporated this analyzer in Luke as well\nas used it successfully in a recent project of my company (EBS Ltd.).\n\nI hope you will find it a useful addition to the project.",
