Performance on modern JVMs is very good for both RWLock and synchronized blocks and to make a big difference heavy contention is needed anyway. I would not expect any difference if you are on a Java 6 JVM at all even if you'd have heavy contention. I have looked into this too a while ago and came to the same conclusion as earwin, there seem to be no real gain in refactoring this to use RWLocks instead fo sync blocks. ",

            "body": "I did hit an AIOOBE though, and I use IBM's JDK, which its CHM apparently uses AbstractCollection's impl of toArray(Object[]). The question is, why should we rely on toArray() implemented one way or the other in which JDK? If we think the best impl would be to allocate an ArrayList and add all the elements to it, then why not do this explicitly? Remember that before this change, listAll() would do almost exactly that - it iterated on the keySet() and added to items to an array, only then it could rely on size().\n\nApparently, doing new ArrayList(fileMap.keySet()) is not safe either, as internally it allocates an array and calls the set's toArray. So I ended up writing the following code and comment:\n\n{code}\n    // NOTE: due to different implementations of different JDKs, it's not safe\n    // to do either:\n    // 1. return fileMap.keySet().toArray(new String[0])\n    // 2. return new ArrayList<String>(fileMap.keySet()).toArray(new String[0])\n    // as both can result in ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException, in case the keySet()\n    // is modified while this method is executed.\n    // Therefore we must clone the set in the following manner, never relying on\n    // keySet() size (even though it's used, ArrayList grows as needed.\n    Set<String> fileNames = fileMap.keySet();\n    List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>(fileNames.size());\n    for (String name : fileNames) names.add(name);\n    return names.toArray(new String[names.size()]);\n{code}",
