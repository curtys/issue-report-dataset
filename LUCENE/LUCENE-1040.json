Here's the approach I took:\n- change makeStopSet return a CharArraySet\n- make CharArraySet a real Set (plus many other small changes)\n  - the Iterator returns Strings for backward compatibility with people that\n   expect a Set<String>\n- StopFilter constructor to directly use Set if instanceof CharArraySet\n\nAll tests pass.",

All tests pass.\n\nI noticed that in your patch you now assume that String.hashCode() is\nalways as described in Sun's javadocs, but that makes me a little\nnervous, eg:\n\n    http://forum.java.sun.com/thread.jspa?threadID=762602&messageID=4351604\n\nMaybe for the String case we should continue computing hashCode\nourselves?\n",
