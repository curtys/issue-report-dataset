Also, and it's a style issue, can you remove the '== true/false' from ifs?\n\nNo.  :-).  Feel free to leave them out, but I prefer it to be explicit.  See my rant at: http://www.lucidimagination.com/search/document/476a10c1c687971d/randomseedgenerator#684ed7253617ea71\n\nbq. I'd change if (clnName.equals(\"\") == false) to if (clnName.length() > 0).\n\nSure.\n\nbq. Why does benchmark/build.xml now relies on the compiled classes/test (of core)?\n\nHmm, guess I didn't see that English got moved from test to core.",
