            "body": "I've attached a patch that fixes this.\n\nThe fix is to close the IndexInput after we've cached the norms in the\nin-memory byte array.  Once we've cached the norms, we never use that\nIndexInput again (as far as I can tell?).  This is also nice because\nit frees up file handles once norms are cached.\n\nChanges:\n\n  * Fixed TestMultiSearcher: it was closing a searcher and then\n    continuing to use it.\n\n  * Added unit test case showing this bug before the patch.\n\n  * Improved MockRAMDirectory to \"act like Windows\" by refusing to\n    delete or overwrite an open file.  I removed \"final\" from 2\n    methods (deleteFile, openInput) of RAMDirectory for this.\n\n  * Changed SegmentReader.getNorms to close the Norms after caching.\n",
