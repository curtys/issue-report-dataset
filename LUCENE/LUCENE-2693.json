So:\n\n# delete-by-term: am I right to say it's handled properly in SegmentDeletes.addTerm()?\n# delete-by-query: seems like SegmentDeletes.addQuery() always increments bytesUsed, whether the query was already in the map or not. I think that's wrong, so I'll add a patch that fixes it for you to review.",
