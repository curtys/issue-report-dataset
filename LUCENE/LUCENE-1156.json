From what I can understand, they are used for transclusion (Wikipedia's term) in other documents.  Something like an import statement, if you will.  They can thus be reused across many articles.  So, technically, in order to properly index, one should resolve all the transclusions first, then index.  This doesn't seem worthwhile to do from a parsing standpoint.",

    "description": "The EnwikiDocMaker currently produces a fair number of documents that are in the download, but are of dubious use in terms of both benchmarking and indexing.  \n\nThese issues are:\n\n# Redirect (it currently only handles REDIRECT and redirect, but there are documents as Redirect\n# Template files appear to be useless.  These are marked by the term Template: at the beginning of the body.  See for example: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:=)\n# Image only pages, as in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Sciencefieldnewark.jpg.jpg  These are about as useful as the Redirects and Templates\n# Files pending deletion:  This one is a bit trickier to handle, but they are generally marked by \"Wikipedia:Votes for deletion\" or some variation of that depending where along it is in being deleted\n\nI think I can implement this such that it is backward compatible, if there is such a need when it comes to the contrib/benchmark suite.\n\n\n\n",
