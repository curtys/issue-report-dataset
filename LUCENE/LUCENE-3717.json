    "description": "Recently lots of issues have been fixed about broken offsets, but it would be nice to improve the\ntest coverage and test that they work across the board (especially with charfilters).\n\nin BaseTokenStreamTestCase.checkRandomData, we can sometimes pass the analyzer a reader wrapped\nin a \"MockCharFilter\" (the one in the patch sometimes doubles characters). If the analyzer does\nnot call correctOffsets or does incorrect \"offset math\" (LUCENE-3642, etc) then eventually\nthis will create offsets and the test will fail.\n\nOther than tests bugs, this found 2 real bugs: ICUTokenizer did not call correctOffset() in its end(),\nand ThaiWordFilter did incorrect offset math.",
