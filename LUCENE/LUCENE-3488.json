            "body": "here is a patch that extracts a common SearcherManager abstract class providing simply static methods to get a SM instance for either Directory or IndexWriter. NRTManager handles all the versioning and provides methods to wait for generations just like it did before. However, NRTManager doesn't return IS anymore but SearcherManager instead. There are still a hand full of nocommits (javadoc) in the patch but since this is a major change to what we had before I figured I should upload it.\n\n",

People love to jump on Solr code, but generally it's not very strong arguments. The UpdateHandler was redesigned IMO - I tackled that with an open page. If someone thinks it should be redesigned further, the proof is in the pudding. I'm happy where I took it at the moment. Wasn't a big redesign because in the end, that was not necessary - it was not a bad design to start - some of it was simply dated compared to Lucene advancements.",

    "description": "Currently we have NRTManager and SearcherManager while NRTManager contains a big piece of the code that is already in SearcherManager. Users are kind of forced to use NRTManager if they want to have SearcherManager goodness with NRT. The integration into NRTManager also forces you to maintain two instances even if you know you always want deletes. To me NRTManager tries to do more than necessary and mixes lots of responsibilities ie. handling searchers and handling indexing generations. NRTManager should use a SearcherManager by aggregation rather than duplicate a lot of logic. SearcherManager should have a NRT and Directory based implementation users can simply choose from.",
