These made SegmentMerger fail.\n\nCan you please supply a test case that demonstrate SegmentMerger failing? Your next() in InstantiatedTermEnum() changes the behaviour InstantiatedIndexReader#terms() compared to IndexReader#terms() and makes the index comparation test to to fail:\n\n{code}\njunit.framework.AssertionFailedError: expected:<a:0> but was:<a:1>\n\tat org.apache.lucene.store.instantiated.TestIndicesEquals.testEquals(TestIndicesEquals.java:244)\n{code}\n\nInstantiatedIndex#fieldSettingsByFieldName that getFieldNames(FieldOption) seem to only be updated by InstantiatedIndexWriter and not when populated by InstantiatedIndex(IndexReader).\n\nCan you please supply test cases that demonstrate getFieldNames(FieldOption) works with both index population strategies? \n\nI think you can factor out the FieldSetting class from InstantiatedIndexWriter as it now is used by InstantiatedIndex and InstantiatedIndexReader too.\n\nbq. A few additional updates related to deleted docs in InstantiatedIndexReader\n\nThis looks good. I noticed that TestIndicesEquals does not actually delete any documents and make sure the indices still equals. I can fix that.\n\n\nAlso, please try not to reformat the code, it makes it harder to see the important changes. \n\nThanks!",

The previous patch just copied the most recent field setting from the writer, thus changing a setting  from true to false in some cases.\n\nI think that was all. I'll be committing this soon pending any comments.",

Can you paste it here?\n\nIt's a bit dangerous to go modifying the Document instances returned by InstantiatedIndexReader unless you are really sure of what you are doing. The documents are the actual index document instances and not a deserialized clones as when using the Directory implementations. \n\nIf you delete a field of such a document it's gone from the index. If you add a new field not previously known in the index, it will not be in sync with field options and you'll probably see strange side effects when merging with other indices, et c.  \n\nThis could also be seen as a great feature that was lost in documentation. One of my favorites is to store the domain object(s) as Fieldable in the document(s) representing them.\n\nI'll add an appropriate comment about this in the javadocs.\n\n",
