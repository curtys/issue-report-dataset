            "body": "I started to rewrite some stuff, very straightforward.\n\n- BufferedDeletesStream has to be changed as it was also calling Query.weight, but I replaced the usage here by QueryWrapperFilter and getting the DocIdSet. Code gets much easier here.\n- QueryWrapperFilter's hack was rewritten, easy\n- in TestFrameWork, QueryUtils were also rewritten, they often use weight, but thats internal only.\n\nThe main issue:\nIn IndexSearcher is already a method called createWeight(Query) (which currently delegates to the Query). I moved the code over here. I have to still complain about the name, it creates a Weight yes, but it should also note that it rewrites and normalizes the weight. So I would like to rename that method, too and deprecate the old one.\n\nFor now I leave the name unchanged. Patch comes soon (core only).",

I commented them out for now\n- QueryValueSource is still to be investigated, I dont completely understand how it works, it looks fine for now (tests pass) but I have to follow how it works. Maybe Yonik can help. There was also a bug in fcontext preventing caching the weight. There is a reflection hack in it for now (nocommit)\n\nThis patch also fixes:\n- Solr's BoostedQuery was fixed, too\n\nI still dont like the name of the protected method in IndexSearcher createWeight(), as it does more than that. It rewrites, creates the weight and then normalizes the query. I would like to rename it and make it maybe public, but expert only.\n\nFor 3.x I would do the rename, too, and use VirtualMethod to fix invocations by 3rd party code if overridden.",

    "description": "We had this issue several times, latest in LUCENE-3207.\n\nThe method Query.weight() was left in Query for backwards reasons in Lucene 2.9 when we changed Weight class. This method is only to be called on top-level queries - and this is done by IndexSearcher. This method is just a utility method, that has nothing to do with the query itsself (it just combines the createWeight method and calls the normalization afterwards). \n\nThe problem we have is that any query that wraps other queries (like CustomScore, ConstantScore, Boolean) calls Query.weight() instead of Query.createWeight(), it will do normalization two times, leading to strange bugs.\n\nFor 3.3 I will make Query.weight() simply delegate to IndexSearcher's replacement method with a big deprecation warning, so user sees this. In IndexSearcher itsself the method will be protected to only be called by itsself or subclasses of IndexSearcher. Delegation for backwards is no problem, as protected is accessible by classes in same package.\n\nI would suggest the method name to be IndexSearcher.createNormalizedWeight(Query q)",
