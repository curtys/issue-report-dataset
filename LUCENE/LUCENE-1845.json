I guess you changed the get url in bdb-je/build.xml but this file (the je.jar) is not the cause of this issue unless I got something wrong. I thought this issues is caused by the fact that http://downloads.osafoundation.org/db/db-${db.version}.jar is not available on a regular basis. Thats why I did not patch this sub-module.\n\nsimon",

I would rather say the build must fail asif we du a release build the jar will not be included. \n\nI think, ideally, If it's the nightly build that's running, the disposition should be robust (ignored), else it should be brittle (like it is today).\n\nI'm not sure about hosting the JARs.  The license for bdb-je is at http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/berkeley-db/htdocs/jeoslicense.html and for bdb http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/berkeley-db/htdocs/oslicense.html.  I think these libs were LGPL'd before Oracle acquired Sleepycat, which was why we could not host them, but I have no idea if Oracle's licensing would permit us to host/redistribute them.  Maybe an inquiry on legal@ is the next step?  If the licensing allows it, I think the simplest solution would be to check them in to our svn repository....\n",

I'm not a license guy but I guess we should first figure out what license this particular jar has. It is not a download from the oracle page (you can only get the sources for this particular jar not the binary as a download) but something from  http://downloads.osafoundation.org/db/ without any license notice.\n\nI would suggest to try to build the jar from source with the latest release on the oracle page so we can be sure about the license. Once I have done this I will send another request to legal to confirm tha we are not violating anything.\n\nThe discussion from legal-discuss\n{noformat}\n> Hey there,\n> We (lucene) have a contrib project that provides a Index-Directory\n> implementation based on BerkleyDB. This code downloads a jar file from\n> http://downloads.osafoundation.org/... to build and test the code.\n> This jar-file is not included in any distribution and we do not plan\n> to do so. The problem is that the download site is down very\n> frequently so we are looking for another way to obtain the jar. Here\n> is the question do we violate the license if we add the jar-file to\n> the svn repository but not distributing it at all? Another way would\n> be to add the jar to a commiter page on people.apache.org and download\n> it from there.\n> The license is here:\n> http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/berkeley-db/htdocs/oslicense.html\n\nComplicated matter.\nBDB seems viral in that anything that uses must be made available in\nsource form. So, ASF has no problem fulfilling that requirement, but\ndownstream users may. OTOH, you say that the BDB is only used to build\n(do you really need it to build?) and test your implementation, BUT\nyou say that you have an implementation based on BDB, so I presume\nthat it requires it to run.\n\nMy interpretation is;\n * IFF your component is purely optional, having a dependency on BDB\nis Ok, provided it is not shipped with the release and that the user\nis provided with the information that the BDB needs to be downloaded\nseparately and advised to review their license.\n\nFor your second part; Can you stick the BDB jar(s) somewhere more\nreliably available?\n * Yes, I think so. The license allows distribution in any form,\nsource or binary... So, I suggest that you upload it to a dependable\nhost, such as SF, ibiblio.org or similar. people.apache.org --> I\nwouldn't recommend it. ASF SVN --> yes, that should be Ok, but there\nis a strong recommendation of not putting JARs in there... Also there\nis a risk that the encumbrance around BDB is forgotten and used beyond\nwhat is acceptable if it is 'laying around'.\n\n\nCheer\n{noformat}",
