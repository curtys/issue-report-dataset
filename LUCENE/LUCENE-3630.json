I will make the internal implementation private for both classes (they were protected because of the above override issue) and rename it to doReopen().\n\nThe same on trunk, where some relicts of those method signatures are still protected. But the bug does not occur here.",

The use was calling openIfChanged(true) on MultiReader -> he got a clone instead of a reopened reader. The fix is to also implement doOpenIfChanged(boolean openReadOnly), but allow only true as param and throw UOE on false.",

This makes consumers calling IR.openIfChanged(boolean readOnly) do the wrong thing. Instead they should get UOE like for the other unimplemented doOpenIfChanged methods in MR and PR.\n\nEasy fix is to rename and hide this internal \"reopen\" method, like DirectoryReader,...",
