However, the output of this method looks like the following:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>some value = some description</li>\n  <ul>\n    <li>some nested value = some description</li>\n  </ul>\n</ul>\n\nAs it is illegal in HTML to nest a UL directly inside a UL, this method will always output unparseable HTML if there are nested explanations.\n\nWhat Lucene probably means to output is the following, which is valid HTML:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>some value = some description\n    <ul>\n      <li>some nested value = some description</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n",
