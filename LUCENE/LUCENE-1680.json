Otherwise it would have been mutable and therefore I would have preferred to just return the prefix length.\nI added a new version of the patch. Thanks",

Also, I think we can't suddenly change protected methods to private (that breaks back compat).\n\nI meant to say \"can't suddenly change add 'final' to protected methods\", but I see from your new patch that you understood what I meant anyway :)\n\nPatch looks good -- I'll commit shortly.  Thanks!",

    "description": "PrefixTermEnum#difference() offers a way to influence scoring based on the difference between the prefix Term and a term in the enumeration. To effectively use this facility the length of the prefix should be accessible to subclasses. Currently the prefix term is private to PrefixTermEnum. I added a getter for the prefix length and made PrefixTermEnum#endEnum(), PrefixTermEnum#termCompare() final for consistency with other TermEnum subclasses.\n\nPatch is attached.\n\nSimon",
