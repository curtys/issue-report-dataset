It will, however, not mean that a new version of the Lucene can't read an old version within the same major version.\n\nto something like this (rough draft)?\n\nThis change only affects the Fieldable API; other backwards\ncompatibility promises remain intact.  For example, Lucene can still\nread and write indices created within the same major version.\n",

We heavily advertise (on java-dev and java-user and maybe general) that in the next minor release of Lucene (2.4), Fieldable will be changing. It is also marked at the top of CHANGES.txt very clearly for all the world to see. Since 2.4 is probably at least a month away, I think this gives anyone with a pulse enough time to react. ",
