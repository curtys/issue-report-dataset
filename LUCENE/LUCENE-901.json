Do we really want the curve of values from queryNorm to have a step drop down from really *huge* values when sumOfSquaredWeights is \"near\" zero to \"1\" when sumOfSquaredWeights becomes so close to zero it can only be represented as 0.0f ?\n\nFloat.MAX_VALUE seems like a better choice then 1, but I haven't really thought through wether or not that will still trigger NaN scores.",

BooleanWeight multiplies the queryNorm by it's boost before calling normalize on the nested weights (hence if the top-level boost is zero, it will call normalize(0.0f) on the subweights).\nSpanWeight doesn't seem to do nested normalization at all.\nNot sure if all the explain implementations would handle it correctly though.",
