This should be fine now, but we need to fix the FuzzyQuery tests to checks for multiple segments with the same terms that should fail with this patch.\n\nMaybe we need a separate MTQ tests that creates two IndexWriters which add documents with an overlapping term set to both indexes. Queries are then ran using MzultiReader, so we can control merging and make sure the term appears really in two \"segments\". I will work on a test for that.",

Here are some comments...\n\n* In CutOffTermCollector:\n{code} final BytesRefHash pendingTerms = new BytesRefHash(new ByteBlockPool(new RecyclingByteBlockAllocator()));{code}\nSice we do not reuse the allocator we don't need to use the synced one here. There is no reset call anywhere to free the allocated blocks too. We should just use new BytesRefHash() here.\n\n\n* BooleanQueryRewrite#rewrite uses a HashMap to keep track of BytesRef and TermFreqBoost. I wonder if we should make use of the ParallelArray technique we us in the indexing chain together with a BytesRefHash which could safe us lots of object creation and GC cost would be lower to once MTQ gets under load. Those MTQ can create a very large amount of objects though and this seems to be a hot spot. I currently have use-cases for direct support of something like a ParallelArray base class in LUCENE-2186 and it seems we can use it here too.\n\n* In FloatsUtil#nextAfter I wonder if we need the following lines:  {code}\nreturn new Float(direction)\n...\nreturn Double.valueOf(direction).floatValue();\n{code} since those methods do nothing else than a (float) direction case really.",

Normally the terms\ncache would save you here, but, we never cache a miss and so when we\ntry to look that up again it's always a real (costly) seek.\n\nWith this approach we can disable using the terms cache entirely from\nMTQ.rewrite, which is great.\n\nI believe the patch works correctly, at least for this test, because\non my 10M wikipedia index it gets identical top N results as clean\ntrunk.

Boosts should never be sumed up.\n- The parts for update with LUCENE-2702 are marked, they wrap currently with new BytesRef(#get(i)) and should be replaced with code like it was before using PagedBytes\n- The work for creating the BytesStartArray is much to do, maybe we can unfinal the DirectBytesStartArray and reuse the code. This would make it easier to extend it and simply add more parallel arrays. Client code should not need to replcate the code (this is maybe another issue).\n- But there is also a problem with the current code in TermFreqBoostByteStart: The arrays may not use the exact same size as expected (depending how oversize/grow works). As they are parallel arrays, all should be equal size, so we should only use grow/oversize only for the base array and resize the others to same size. Do we have an ArrayUtil method for that? Currently it (may) be broken. Any comments?",

For random queries it had a huge positive impact on query perf. \n\nIf the clauses were just term queries, that would make me really suspect the test.\nIf it was MTQ queries, then MTQ should sort, not BQ.\n\nbq. The BQ cloning/reordering was not measureable.\n\nRight - I would expect that for typical queries and typical uses.\nI guess I'm worried about the atypical cases since I've seen so many of them - people putting together single boolean queries with 10K clauses, people doing complex nested queries with thousands of terms, or people executing thousands of queries per request (or per document added, via memory index) where this overhead suddenly becomes significant.\n\nbq. We are still working on this patch, its marked as TODO, so we will investigate further.\n\nCool :-)",

            "body": "Attached is a new patch with two changes:\n\n- moved the BQ reordering to MTQ for now. A general reordering of BooleanQueries should be done in a separate issue (with more performant rewrite). Currently this uses the same comparator like BQ before. You may wonder: why not simply use a sorted map? - the idea is that sorting at the end is faster than using a TreeMap where all terms are compared against (even those falling out of queue). I sort the BQ clauses directly like BQ, to not create an additional array to hold all terms again. Maybe its still faster by copying all BytesRefs to an array before and then build BQ? For now this should be enough. To improve we need SorterTemplate again (for the BytesRefHash case) :-)\n- fixed an issue with the PQ in TopTermsRewrite: The bottom information was previously only set when the PQ was overflowing. In the past and now its set once the queue is full. This was an optimization bug, its now as it was always. Maybe this explains Mike's score changes on wikipedia index?\n\nMike: can you test?",

This patch also contains a test that this resorting works.\n\nIt also has an assert that the docFreq is correct. This only slows down tests, but is more secure!\n\nNow we only need to fix contrib and Mike can check the performance (Mike: you have to update your current trunk checkout, too - so scores will compare correct).",

All tests currently pass, but FuzzyQuery's tests should not, because it depends for the minimum score handling, that the terms are collected in order..\n\nRobert will fix FuzzyQuery in this issue, too.
