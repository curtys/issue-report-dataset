    "description": "Today, BlockJoinQuery can join from child docIDs up to parent docIDs.\nEG this works well for product (parent) + many SKUs (child) search.\n\nBut the reverse, which BJQ cannot do, is also useful in some cases.\nEG say you index songs (child) within albums (parent), but you want to\nsearch and present by song not album while involving some fields from\nthe album in the query.  In this case you want to wrap a parent query\n(against album), joining down to the child document space.\n",
