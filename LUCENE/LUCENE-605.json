Many of the \"micro explanations\" of things like coord value and tf, and idf don't really make sense with a \"match\" boolean, and even the ones that do don't really need it.   But if anything that just reaffirmed my faith in the isMatch() function using the Boolean if it's set, and infering it from the float value if it's not -- but eliminating the 2 arg constructor is certainly impractical -- so is automatically including the getMatchString() in the toString(int) .. but I am thinking that if/when I change all the Query.explain methods to use the new match Boolean, I'll also update the description to say wether it was a match .. either that or add it to the toString() method (ie: just at the top level without the recursion) ... but that's a secondary isue to getting the logic right.\n",

            "body": "The purpose of Explanation is to explain all the \"mysteries\" of query search, so it would be worthwhile to use an extra class for the micro explanations. Since these currently are just Explanations without a match, why not make the micro explanations  a superclass of Explanation?\nIt might even be simpler to make MatchExplanation a subclass of the existing Explanation, and hope that that does not break backwards compatbility later (I don't know.)\nSuch a class structure would be counterintuitive to Matcher as superclass/superinterface of Scorer, so maybe it should be the other way round: make MatchExplanation a superclass of Explanation.\n\nSorry for the rant, I should take a bit more time to consider things before typing comments...\n",

            "body": "Hmmm... a subclass relationship might make a lot of sense here ... if we add an isMatch() method to the existing \"Explanation\" which infers it's state from the value, a subclass could allow the matchiness to be explicitly set in cases where it makes sense.  This would have the added benefit of reducing the amount of changes needed in all of hte vaiours uses of Explanation rihgt now.\n\nMaking a new MatchExplanation that superclasses Explanation seems trickier .. MatchExplanation would need a setMatch method to be usefull, but we dont' want that method in Explanation (so we'd need to override it to through an unsupported exception orosmething).  Personally I don't think having MatchExplanation subclass Explanation would be all that confusion if a new Matcher auperinterface was added above Scorer -- there's no direct correllary between a Scorer and an Explanation anyway (that's what started this whole discussion right, that Explanation is frequencly used to model things much smaller then a basic Doc/Score.\n\n> Sorry for the rant, I should take a bit more time to consider things before typing comments...\n\n...wow, I'm more jaded then I thought ...
