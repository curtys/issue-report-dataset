Previously NRTManager did this all itself, but now you may need to share this tracking across 2 NRTManagers so I had to pull it out... ",

            "body": "mike, I like the simplification. I think we talked about this last time we touched this code already. I think this is the most common use-case... Yet, I don't think NRTManager should expose IndexSearcher directly. Think of an app that either uses NRT or commit / reopen ie. uses a NRTManager and a PlainOldIndexManager. From a user perspective SearcherManager is the main interface to search the index no matter how you commit / flush / NRT etc. I'd rather keep it exposing the SM instead. \n\nabout TrackingIndexWriter - I think we should fix IW to use seq ids eventually but I think for this purpose its fine.",

Ie at that point, both SM and NRTM are ThingyManager<IndexSearcher>?\n\nI don't like the extra indirection (you get an SM from NRTM) because now you have two linked instances.  For example, it opens up the risk that the app will (incorrectly) call SM.maybeReopen instead of NRTM.maybeReopen.  I think having the one manager to work with is less dangerous...",

It serves two different purposes and we shouldn't try to couple tight if not needed.",

This should be no less efficient than we have today,\njust simpler.\n\nI think it will also enable NRTManager to subclass ThingyManager\n(LUCENE-3761).\n",
