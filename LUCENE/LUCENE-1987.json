Just remove the get/setters and only use the version constant to enable the backwards settings? If I remove these settings internally in StopAnalyzer and StopFilter and Standard*, too, I also have to remove some version support.\n\nHow would you proceed?\n\nFurthermore: The \"deprecated\" check for overridden tokenStream methods to fix this bug, if somebody subclasses a core-Analyzer, what to do with them. As the tokenStream methods is not deprecated in favour of reusableTokenStream, how to prevent this in future. Keep this reflection checks? Or make the Analyzers final?",

How should we handle the deprecated settings inside? \n\nFor \"replace invalid acronym\" in StandardAnalyzer, there is no version setting that enables that currently, so I'm afraid we must keep those until 4.0 (since they impact your index by altering analysis)?  Or, maybe we could add a Versions.LUCENE_23, which'd re-enable that bug (the default for that setting changed to \"true\" (= fix the bug) in 2.4).  Hmm.\n\nFor \"stop position increments\" in StandardAnalyzer, I think we should remove the direct getter/setters and expose only Versions.LUCENE_24 to get back to that behavior?\n\nStopFilter should keep its \"stop position increments\" setting (it's not deprecated).",

Because of that, the pre 2.9 default was false (which is now not changeable). So I set the posIncr to false for all older versions (this was the default before, but is now fixed as no static setter/sysprop anymore)\n\nFor the invalid acronyms I added LUCENE_23 version constant, so for all versions >=2.3 it is enabled. If you want old behaviour, use LUCENE_22 or below.\n\nMike: Can you review this?\n\nIf you're ok with it I have to change 175 \"new StandardAnalyzer()\" occurences in tests :(",

That's a back compat trap (and it just gets us back to where we started when we had no explicit version).  Users must be explicit about which version they want.\n\nWhat I meant was: when fixing some sneaky bug in the future, we should never set the default so that the bug is still present (as we did on the first go of \"invalid acronyms\"), expecting new users to realize they have to go out of their way to tell Lucene not to emulate the bug.  Instead, the default going forward (if version >= next-release-version) should be \"the bug is fixed\".",

Most contrib tests also pass, but we have the following problems and inconsistencies:\n\n- benchmark does not work any longer, because StandardAnalyzer has no default ctor anymore and cannot be instantiated by reflection, same with StopAnalyzer\n- Highlighter only works, if StandardAnalyzer is in 2.4 mde, in 2.9 mode (current) it fails because the position increments of stop words are not correctly respected. This fails in addition/combination with the following:\n- Very bad inconsistency: The default of QueryParser is to ignore position increments, but the current version of StandardAnalyzer uses posIncr for stop words -> b\u00e4ng. We should change the default for QueryParser(+ contrib QP), too. There is march rework needed and much documentation. The tests in core now pass, as most parts use StandardAnalyzer in 2.9 mode but have no stop words. And the special tests explicitely set the posIncr flag. This is totally disturbed, it needs fixing! (it also affects 2.9.0, if somebody uses the new StandardAnalyzer with LUCENE_CURRENT). \n- XMLQueryParser also fails with latest StandardAnalyzer version, because it cannot set the flag in QueryParser. In my opinion, the query parser should take the flag from the analyzer, but this is not easy to fix.\n- All contrib analyzers have stopWordPosIncr turned off (backwards compatibility). Maybe we need a Version Parameter in all analyzers there too!\n\nWhat to do?

They are deprecated, but we still have the VERSION constants. Do not know, how to proceed. Keep the settings alive for index compatibility? Or remove it together with the version constants (which were undeprecated).",
