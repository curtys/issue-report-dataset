            "body": "Just to double check the math:\nFrom the Website:\n\"DocDelta determines both the document number and the frequency. In particular, DocDelta/2 is the difference between this document number and the previous document number (or zero when this is the first document in a TermFreqs). When DocDelta is odd, the frequency is one. When DocDelta is even, the frequency is read as another VInt.\"\n\nSo, 15 is the correct start since 15 /2 as an int is 7 and the frequency is one.  Then the difference between doc 7 and 11 is 4, so the next value should be 8 (since DocDelta/2 = 11 - 7, which is even, meaning the frequency is the next VInt, in this case 3, so I would concur.\n\n",
