    "description": "I recently inherited a project from an ex-colleague; it uses Lucene and in\nparticular the HTML Parser.  I've found that she had made an amendment to the\nparser to allow it to parse and decode hexadecimal character references, which\nwe depend on, but had not reported a bug.  If she had, someone might have\npointed out that her correction was wrong ...\n\nI don't seem to be able to attach the (fairly trivial) patch to an initial bug\nreport (and in any case I've failed to find the instructions for generating a\ndiff file in the right format, even though I'm sure I've seen it somewhere).",
