I always prefer an empty collection over null so you can simply replace the null checks with stopSet.isEmpty(). -- kind of unrelated and we can do in sep. issue if you want.\n",

    "description": "As discussed on the java-user list, the SnowballAnalyzer has been updated to use a Set of stop words. However, there is no constructor which accepts a Set, there's only the original String[] one\n\nThis is an issue, because most of the common sources of stop words (eg StopAnalyzer) have deprecated their String[] stop word lists, and moved over to Sets (eg StopAnalyzer.ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS_SET). So, for now, you either have to use a deprecated field on StopAnalyzer, or manually turn the Set into an array so you can pass it to the SnowballAnalyzer\n\nI would suggest that a constructor is added to SnowballAnalyzer which accepts a Set. Not sure if the old String[] one should be deprecated or not.\n\nA sample patch against 2.9.1 to add the constructor is:\n\n\n--- SnowballAnalyzer.java.orig  2009-12-15 11:14:08.000000000 +0000\n+++ SnowballAnalyzer.java       2009-12-14 12:58:37.000000000 +0000\n@@ -67,6 +67,12 @@\n     stopSet = StopFilter.makeStopSet(stopWords);\n   }\n \n+  /** Builds the named analyzer with the given stop words. */\n+  public SnowballAnalyzer(Version matchVersion, String name, Set stopWordsSet) {\n+    this(matchVersion, name);\n+    stopSet = stopWordsSet;\n+  }\n+\n",
