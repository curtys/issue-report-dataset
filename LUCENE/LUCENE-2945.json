Anyway, that issue would be the same for an implementation of equals() and hashCode() all over the class hierarchy.\n",

I'm not entirely thrilled about the implementation of equals/hash on the two inner classes (used to be anonymous) but I do think it works.  Namely, I use the syntax of the original query as a string, per Paul's original suggestion as part of the hash/equals.  It just seems awkward to have to pass that in solely for this purpose, but I didn't see what other information I had around that would make the object unique from an equals/hash standpoint.  I suppose the underlying queries list on the ComposedQuery might work and I can try that if others think it makes more sense.",

An explicit reference from an object of a named static inner class gets around that, and I am curious to know whether equals() could be implemented without an explicit reference in this case.\n\nI have started coding in these directions, once some tests pass I'll post a patch.\n",

I don't really care about the outer containing classes other than I think it is a misnomer to call them Query classes when they really are factory classes for creating Lucene Queries.",

It adds static inner classes to with hashCode() and equals() as needed here.\nFor now, these classes throw a RuntimeException created from a CloneNotSupportedException in their clone() methods. This leaves clone() not correctly implemented, but at least now a RuntimeException is thrown instead of previously returning an incorrect result.\n\nThe patch also includes a single passing test in SrndQueryTest for equal queries when parsed from strings that only differ in whitespace. The other tests there have been commented out because they use clone() via QueryUtils\n\nMore tests are still needed, also  for inequality. The earlier tests all pass.\n\n",

The static inner classes have been moved to package private classes, and their common function was moved to a new super class.\n\nAlso a few more test cases were added. Test cases for testing not equals might be still be added, but I don't see a real need to do that.\n\nAs this adds handling equals/hashcode and has hardly any redundancy, I think this is close to committable. The patch also deprecates a compare..() method, I don't know whether the comments there are to the point.\n",
