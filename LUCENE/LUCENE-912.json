That means that the score() might be computed on the wrong subscorer docs after the first call to next().\n\nBut this issue is about DisjunctionMaxScorer.skipTo(), and removing the firstTime return statement there is correct I think.\n\n",

So the first time that next() is called, sub-scorers are already \"on the right spot\", and not so for the first time skipTo() is called, because skipTo does not necessarily goes to the first match.",
