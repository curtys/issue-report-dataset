I\nhave a another process that updates the index used by the search server and\nthat asks the searcher server to reopen its index reader after the updates\ncompleted.\n\nWhen I reopen() the index reader, I also close the old one (if the reopen()\nyielded a new instance). This causes problems for the other threads that\nare currently in the middle of a search request.\n\nI'd like to propose the addition of two methods, acquire() and release() \n(attached to this bug report), that increment/decrement the ref count that IndexReader \ninstances currently maintain for related purposes. That ref count prevents \nthe index reader from being actually closed until it reaches zero.\n\nMy server's search threads, thus acquiring and releasing the index reader \ncan be sure that the index reader they're currently using is good until \nthey're done with the current request, ie, until they release() it.\n",
