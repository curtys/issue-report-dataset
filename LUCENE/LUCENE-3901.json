            "body": "Find attached a patch for this.\n\nThe stemming is done by {{KuromojiKatakanaStemFilter}}, which has been added to {{KuromojiAnalyzer}} and a corresponding {{KuromojiKatakanaStemFilterFactory}} has been added to the {{text_ja}} field type in {{schema.xml}}.\n\nNote that this stemming is now turned on by default and I think it makes good sense to do so.  The minimum length of a token considered for stemming is configurable and I've made the default of 4 explicit in {{schema.xml}} to convey that it's there.\n\nThe stemmer only supports full-width katakana and should be used in combination with a {{CJKWidthFilter}} if stemming half-width characters is required and you're doing your wiring.  Both {{text_ja}} and {{KuromojiAnalyzer}} takes care of this, and the default overall processing is the same.\n\nThere are some test cases in {{TestKuromojiKatakanaStemFilter}}, but I've added a case to {{TestKuromojiAnalyzer}} that demonstrates how the stemming works in combination with katakana compound splitting.\n\nIn Japanese, \"manager\" can be written both as \u30de\u30cd\u30fc\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc and \u30de\u30cd\u30fc\u30b8\u30e3 (and probably also \u30de\u30cd\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc), and for the compound \u30b7\u30cb\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u30de\u30cd\u30fc\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc (senior project manager), we now get tokens \u30b7\u30cb\u30a2 (senior) \u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8 (project) \u30de\u30cd\u30fc\u30b8\u30e3 (manager), and we've stemmed the last token by removing the trailing \u30fc.  Kuromoji also makes the compound \u30b7\u30cb\u30a2\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u30de\u30cd\u30fc\u30b8\u30e3 a synonym to \u30b7\u30cb\u30a2, and \u30fc is also removed for the synonym compound.\n\nTests pass and I've also tested this end-to-end in a Solr trunk build.",

    "description": "Many Japanese katakana words end in a long sound that is sometimes optional.\n\nFor example, \u30d1\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc and \u30d1\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3 are both perfectly valid for \"party\".  Similarly we have \u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc and \u30bb\u30f3\u30bf that are variants of \"center\" as well as \u30b5\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc and \u30b5\u30fc\u30d0 for \"server\".\n\nI'm proposing that we add a katakana stemmer that removes this long sound if the terms are longer than a configurable length.  It's also possible to add the variant as a synonym, but I think stemming is preferred from a ranking point of view.\n\n",
