            "body": "+1 This looks reasonable to me.  What is important is that IndexReader holds the COMMIT lock while all files are opened.  But the writer does not need to be held while they're removed, only while the set of files is changing, to keep readers from reading the set, then trying to open files after they've been deleted.  This is still blocked after your patch, since the set cannot change while files are being opened.",

(on a Windows system that is...)\n",

    "description": "Same happens in IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader[] readers).\n\nThe commit lock should be obtained whenever the Index structure/version is read or written.  It should be kept for as short a period as possible.\n\nThe write lock is needed to make sure only one IndexWriter or IndexReader instance can update the index (multiple IndexReaders can of course use the index for searching).\n\nThe list of files that can be deleted is stored in the file \"deletable\".  It is only read or written by the IndexWriter instance that holds the write lock, so there's no need to have the commit lock to to update it.\n\nOn my production system deleting the obsolete segment files after a mergeSegments() happens can occasionally take several seconds(!) and the commit lock blocks the searcher machines from updating their IndexReader instance.\nEven on a standalone machine, the time to update the segments file is about 3ms, the time to delete the obsolete segments about 30ms.\n",
