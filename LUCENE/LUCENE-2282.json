Using SB is a minor efficiency, and since the + operator on strings allocate it anyway, I figure we'd better allocate it directly, especially when two + operators are involved.\n* matchesExtension checks whether a filename matches an extension\n* fileNameFromGeneration adds the '.' when neccessary.\n* Core code does not concatenate file, '.' and extension on its own, but uses IFN.\n\nAll core tests pass. I have a local problem w/ contrib tests (the Analyzers data dir is locked for some reason and I cannot unlock it), but I see no reasons for them to fail.\n\nIf this can go out in 3.0.2 instead of waiting for 3.1, then all the better.",

What are the applications that we are trying to support by exposing this API?\n\nAny application that extends IW, or provide its own Directory implementation, and wants to reference Lucene's file extensions properly (i.e. not by putting its code under o.a.l.index or hardcoding \".del\" as its deletions file) will benefit from making it public.\nThe class already exists, and declares the right constants and methods. All I want is to expose it as public. This information is not *hidden*, it's out there. We're just making it easier for apps to reference it.\n\nLike Mike mentioned on the java-dev thread http://old.nabble.com/IndexFileNames-td27699103.html, he exposes it (or a variant) on the flex branch as public, because classes outside the 'index' package need to reference it. Indeed once Flex is out, that file will need to change or extend to accommodate pluggable index formats / files, but that's not the matter of this issue. This issue is just about exposing an already existing class as public instead of package-private for convenience ...",

Extensions xyz, abc go do directory 1 and def got do directory 2. That someone will want to reference Lucene extensions in order to achieve that. FSD only takes care of extensions, but someone might need to work on prefixes of files as well.\nYou can say \"that class itself should not care about Lucene's extensions, it should get the extensions/prefixes in a ctor\" ...\n\nWell ... let's take FileSwitchDirectory (which is a core Lucene class) and say I want to instantiate it. I need to pass file extensions. How do I pass the .del file as an extension? Do I hard code it to \".del\" (or just \"del\"?) or, or do I put that code in o.a.l.store just for that?  Or ... we make IndexFileNames publc and I can happily and safely reference it.\nBTW, I'm writing this from a computer w/o the Lucene code -- I wonder how FSD is tested, is the test in o.a.l.index because it references IFN or in o.a.l.store because it tests FSD? If it's the former, then I (usually) think it points at a problem in the design.\n\nThe @lucene.internal tag gives us exactly that freedom. Instead of me putting code in o.a.l.* (and feel like I'm dong something wrong, and make my code look wrong), I can put it in my package but know I'm risking the chance a certain constant or method impl will change in the future. I've already took that risk when I chose to put my code in o.a.l.* so I prefer to take that risk and not make my code look patchy.\n\nI, personally, don't mind what Lucene's back-compat policy is. Whenever I upgrade my code to a new Lucene version, I re-compile anything. I am happy to get rid of deprecated API, I am happy to take advantage of new, more efficient API, and I wouldn't care if a @lucene.internal class changed, as long as it's documented in the \"Changes in back-compat\" section in CHANGES, as a FYI - not because it's a change in the policy, so I can read about it quickly (that's the first section I usually check).\n\nThat class is just a reference to Lucene's core files. If you want to write that 'Sweep' thing, you might benefit from knowing what is a core Lucene file and delegate the sweep task to a core Lucene instance, while sweeping the rest of the files by another instance (which created them?). If Lucene core will create files w/ other names/extensions, then I believe this class (IFN) should be changed entirely, but I don't think making it public blocks any of these changes, as long as it's tagged by @lucene.internal.",

If it's marked as internal, it's an implementation detail.\nWhether or not the dot is included in internal-use-only constant strings isn't\nsomething I'm going to waste a lot of time thinking about. ;)\n\nSo now, not only do I really, really not care whether this goes in, I have no\nqualms about it either.\n\nHaving users like Shai who are willing to recompile and regenerate to take\nadvantage of experimental features is a big boon, as it allows us to test\ndrive features before declaring them stable.  Designing optimal APIs without\nusability testing is difficult to impossible.",
