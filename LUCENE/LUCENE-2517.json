This regex is now generated from the two latest releases.\n# <code> -> <code><pre> (to make them look better in HTML) is now blocked for inline usages, so that newlines are not added to the HTML version when they are not present in CHANGES.txt.\n# Imbalanced parentheses were incorrectly recognized as attribution onset.",

            "body": "This patch contains several typo fixes for CHANGES.txt, and one change: the first item under Changes in backwards compatibility policy (LUCENE-1458, LUCENE-2111, LUCENE-2354: Changes from flexible indexing) includes attribution for individual bulleted items, which is a new usage that I *think* is not intended (copy-paste-o, likely), and several of the people that worked on those three issues are not given credit anywhere AFAICT, so I've moved the attributions attached to bulleted items to below the entire bulleted list, and added everyone who posted a patch to any of the three issues.",
