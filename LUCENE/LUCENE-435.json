            "body": "Hello,\n\nI have done what you requested (sorry for the late delay - too busy). I also found a bug in RAMOutputStream - the implementation of flushBuffer method was not able to write any buffers longer than 2*BUFFER_LENGTH. My fast writeBytes patch now handle all various situation and uses the fastest methods to write data.\n\nIn my opinion its not good to make BUFFER_LENGTH constant public. Consider making it private since this can lead to nontrivial \"dependency\" (as I have described above). Its not good to have one buffer length for input, output and RAM* objects (which should have independant buffer length at all - it has nothing to do with the caching in the abstract methods). Making it private and maybe accessible on runtime could help a litte (as I said -- I use the API for some index copying and I would like to have larger buffers).\n\nAnyway, this is my contribution, I am looking for more reviews. The patch includes StoreTest modification which helps with testing either writeByte method or writeBytes methods. Thanks for your attention.",

I know that for indexing this not help much, but for copying files in the IndexStore this is so big improvement. Its about 400% faster that old implementation.\n\nThe patch was tested with 300MB data, \"ant test\" sucessfuly finished with no errors.",
