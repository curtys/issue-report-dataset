            "body": "here is a patch that factors out multiple base classes shared across variant specific docvalues writers / readers. Numerics subclasses FixedStraightBytesImpl.Writer and reuses and only encodes incoming values as a fixed sized bytes. Other byte variants share common base classes and override necessary parts for their specific variant.\n\nThis removes a large amount of code from docvalues which I should have done earlier. However, this is a first step towards fixing the merge problem since we can now almost exclusively operate on bytes rather than ints, floats, doubles etc. on the implementation level.",
