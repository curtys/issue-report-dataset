Everybody, since version 2, that used to iterate over all documents that way, still expects it to work without calling seek, at least I did.\n\nIn my opinion, being unpositioned means the user needs to be aware about docs being retrieved in any order, all that matters after all is to iterate over all documents in the index.\n\nAnother question is, if indexReader.termDocs(null) is used, where is it positioned if nothing was defined in the parameter? Shouldn't it work as termDocs()? It just feels inconsistent to me.",

In my opinion, being unpositioned means the user needs to be aware about docs being retrieved in any order, all that matters after all is to iterate over all documents in the index.\n\ntermDocs() is unpositioned, implying you will seek() it yourself with Term/TermEnum\n\nbq. Another question is, if indexReader.termDocs(null) is used, where is it positioned if nothing was defined in the parameter? Shouldn't it work as termDocs()? It just feels inconsistent to me.\n\ntermDocs(term) is like termDocs() + seek(term), except for the special null case as listed in the docs (If term is null, then all non-deleted docs are returned with freq=1)\n\ni'm inclined to agree termDocs(null) is inconsistent because it doesnt work like termDocs() + seek(null), but instead returns the wacky AllTermsDocs\n",
