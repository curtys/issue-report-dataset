I completely agree it's an impl detail -- the user should just have to say \"I want constant scoring\" and Lucene finds the most performant way to achieve it.\n\nBut then I realized it's not obvious when one impl should be chosen over another.  Often FILTER is faster than CONSTANT_BOOLEAN_QUERY, but at some point once the index becomes large enough the underlying O(maxDoc) cost (w/ small constant in front) of FILTER will dominate, or if the number of terms/docs that match is small then CONSTANT_BOOLEAN_QUERY will win, etc.  If number of terms exceeds BooleanQuery's maxClauseCount, you must use FILTER.\n\nAnd my intuitions weren't right (I had thought NumericRangeQuery, since in general it doesn't produce too many terms, would perform well with BOOLEAN_QUERY, but from Uwe's numbers that's not the case; though we should re-test now that, with this patch, no CPU is spent on scoring).\n\nSo, I was uncomfortable trying to make Lucene too smart under the hood, at least for this first go at it.\n\nMaybe we could add an AUTO option, that would make try to decide what's best?  This way if we mess up its smarts, the user can still fallback and force one method over another.\n\n(Though, since the maxClauseCount is so clearly a dead-end, maybe even in CONSTANT_BOOLEAN_QUERY mode we should forcefully fallback to FILTER on hitting too many terms).",

What do you think about CONSTANT_AUTO doing your maxClauseCount trick?\n\nI'm thinking there'd be a cutoff on the number of terms.  EG maybe it defaults to 25 (?).

Loading the TermInfo shouldn't be costly, since it's loaded anyway when the query/filter runs (and, it's cached).  We'd then sum it up as we're checking, and if it crosses the threshold (default maybe 10% of maxDoc()?) we'd cut out to FILTER?\n\nThough, if we go this route, we should probably do it under a new CONSTANT_AUTO method (instead of falling back to the clean single boolean constantScoreRewrite), ie, it's getting a little too smart to just always do w/ no way to fallback and force it to just rewrite one way or another.\n\nOr we can punt on any smarts altogether for now (this being the \"eve\" of 2.9) and simply start with the three explicit rewrite methods.",

The latest patch is also a good idea, I only hve some small problems with it:\n- Why did you make so many internal things public? The additional ctor to MultiTermQueryrapperFilter should be package-private or protected (the class is not abstract, but should be used like abstract, so it ,must have only protected ctors). Only the public instances TermRangeFilter should have public ctors.\n- getFilter()/getEnum should stay protected.\n- I do not like the wired caching of Terms. A more cleaner API would be a new class CachingFilteredTermEnum, that can turn on caching for e.g. the first 20 terms and then reset. In this case, the API would stay clear and the filter code does not need to be changed at all (it just harvests the TermEnum, if it is cached or not). I would propose something like: new CachingFilteredTermEnum(originalEnum), use it normally, then termEnum.reset() to consume again and termEnum.purgeCache() if caching no longer needed and to be switched off (after the first 25 terms or so). The problem with MultiTermQueryWrapper filter is, that the filter is normally stateless (no reader or termenum). So normally the method getDocIdSet() should get the termenum or wrapper in addition to the indexreader. This is not very good (it took me some time, to understand, what you are doing). ",

In this case the boolean query would be built and the terms cached. If there are too many terms, it creates a filter instance with the cached terms.\nThe rewritten query is then executed against all sub-readers using the cached terms and a fixed term enum. Normally this would create a docidset for the current index reader, the rewrite did it for the top-level index reader -> the wron doc ids are returned and so on. So you cannot reuse the collected terms from the rewrite operation in the getDocIdSet calls.\n\nSo please turn of this caching at all! As noted before, the important thing is, that the returned filter by rewrite is stateless and should not know anythis about index readers.

I think the rewrite method is internal to MultiTermQuery and always implemented ina subclass of MTQ as inner class.\n\nAlso the current singletons are not really singletons, because queries that are unserialized will contain instances that are not the \"singleton\" instances :) - and will therefore fail to produce correct hashcode/equals tests. The problem behind: The singletons are serializable but do not return itsself in readResolve() (not implemented). All singletons that are serializable must implement readResolve and return the singleton instance (see Parameter base class or the parser singletons in FieldCache).\n\nThe instance in the default Auto RewriteMethod is still modifiable.

The I remembered that nice random seed that was printed out, so I went to the test and wired that seed and BOOM the failure happened.  Thank you Hoss ;)\n\nI found the failure -- I was just failing to incr the term count in the \"auto uses BooleanQuery\" case.  New patch soon...",

I first thought, that you maybe counting the terms two times (one time at the beginning and then again in the filter, if the auto mode switches). But you are now only updating the term count at the end when you build the boolean query.\n\nBy the way: How about initializing the ArrayList not with the default size, but maybe termCount cutoff/2 or something like that?",

    "description": "When MultiTermQuery is used (via one of its subclasses, eg\nWildcardQuery, PrefixQuery, FuzzyQuery, etc.), you can ask it to use\n\"constant score mode\", which pre-builds a filter and then wraps that\nfilter as a ConstantScoreQuery.\n\nIf you don't set that, it instead builds a [potentially massive]\nBooleanQuery with one SHOULD clause per term.\n\nThere are some limitations of this approach:\n\n  * The scores returned by the BooleanQuery are often quite\n    meaningless to the app, so, one should be able to use a\n    BooleanQuery yet get constant scores back.  (Though I vaguely\n    remember at least one example someone raised where the scores were\n    useful...).\n\n  * The resulting BooleanQuery can easily have too many clauses,\n    throwing an extremely confusing exception to newish users.\n\n  * It'd be better to have the freedom to pick \"build filter up front\"\n    vs \"build massive BooleanQuery\", when constant scoring is enabled,\n    because they have different performance tradeoffs.\n\n  * In constant score mode, an OpenBitSet is always used, yet for\n    sparse bit sets this does not give good performance.\n\nI think we could address these issues by giving BooleanQuery a\nconstant score mode, then empower MultiTermQuery (when in constant\nscore mode) to pick & choose whether to use BooleanQuery vs up-front\nfilter, and finally empower MultiTermQuery to pick the best (sparse vs\ndense) bit set impl.\n",
