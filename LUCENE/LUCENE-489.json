            "body": "I'm sure someone mentioned on one of the lists a while back, but there's a technique that we used for an LDAP server that's applicable here.   It's a bit like injecting synonyms: you'd have, say, a SubwordFilter that given \"brown\" would emit \"rown\" and \"own\" at the same position.  A \"*own\" query would then simply drop the leading wildcard and look for the word.   We stopped at three letters in the LDAP server.   An alternative is to use a ReverseAlternativeFilter (say) that emits \"brown\" and \"nworb\" at the same position, but that only deals with prefix or postfix wildcards, but not both.\n\nI'm not sure how you'd stop \"own\" matching \"brown\" though.   If someone could come up with some example code I don't suppose I'd be the only one who would be interested! ",

Disable the support for leading wildcards in the default QueryParser java class implementation but allow users to override that class and enable it there.\n\nI see many people going for different approaches to handling leading wildcard queries through QueryParser and I beleive most of them eventually recompile QueryParser.jj after making the relevant changes there. \n\nThis might not be an issue for Java users (simple run JavaCC again and you have the QueryParser.java source), but it is especially important for users of the ported versions of Lucene (in my case DotLucene). For every Lucene version I have to recreate QueryParser.java using JavaCC and then do the porting job from java to c#.  ",

If there's a compelling reason for it, I'd consider it, but it has to be pretty compelling because of the effort required to (remember to) maintain the local modifications. If someone runs javacc themselves, they'll get a different result and have to look at the code to see why the results are different. I don't see that the benefit of removing a few deprecated methods is worth the potential confusion (and time taken to resolve the confusion) (and time taken to remember to do the local mod every time).",

In terms of the \"patch available\" flag (which I appreciate you watching), I figure that's the flag that the assignee thinks it's ready to be committed. I can imagine adding patches that aren't ready for commit, in which case I wouldn't set the flag.\n\nAs far as doing the commit, I think on Hadoop, the committer just does the svn commit and resolves the Jira issue, w/o changing the assignee.\n\nWe don't have to do it that way, of course, but I do kinda like it that way. I figure if contributors (as opposed to committers) are the lead on any follow-up discussion, that's a good thing, in terms of load balancing?",
