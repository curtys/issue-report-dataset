For the later, I had to promote the transaction routines from private to package protected so that I could write the tests, which are also in the patch.",

That means no change to startTransaction() and rollbackTransaction(). If there could be buffered docs and delete terms when startTransaction(), then local copies should be made for buffered docs and localNumBufferedDeleteTerms should clone numBufferedDeleteTerms instead of just copying the reference.",

I don't have a strong opinion.\n\nI did notice that every call to startTransaction had flushed the deletes ahead but I didn't see that it was required to be so. I can go either way on this, too. I'd vote for making startTransaction safer.  I think, in theory, it could be opened to users at some point, if it were to help people trying to use Lucene in certain transactional contexts.\n\nOf course, that violates YAGNI.\n\nBut I hadn't looked at the ram segments. Does look like if there are any at the start of a trans. and they get flushed, they would/might get lost? Since that touches on the index file deleter, it strikes me as more complex.",

            "body": "I didn't make myself clear. Let me try again. The patch includes two parts of changes to IndexWriter: one adds localNumBufferedDeleteTerms and localBufferedDeleteTerms and uses them in startTransaction() and rollbackTransaction(); the other fixes loss of buffered deletes in flush() (and applyDeletes() which is used by flush()).\n\nThe second part is good and that's where you had the comment on cloning.\n\nI was referring to the first part. In startTransaction(), \"localBufferedDeleteTerms = bufferedDeleteTerms\" reference-copies bufferedDeleteTerms. Then more delete terms are buffered into bufferedDeleteTerms... so localBufferedDeleteTerms would have the delete terms buffered between startTransaction() and the first flush()... ",

The code guarantees that now but\nhow about we doc this limitation and put an assert in there to make\nsure?\n\nThese methods were added only for protecting the index during the\naddIndexes* calls; if in the future we somehow want to make them more\npowerful I think we can fix it then...\n",
