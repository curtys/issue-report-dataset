            "body": "Patch for auto-detecting output compression mode of result line file:\n\n- getInputStream() moved from ContentSource to a new class StreamUtils under util. It is now named inputStream(File).\n- outputStream() method added to StreamUtils.\n\nBefore applying this patch *svn mv modules/benchmark/src/test/org/apache/lucene/benchmark/byTask/feeds/ContentSourceTest.java modules/benchmark/src/test/org/apache/lucene/benchmark/byTask/utils/StreamUtilsTest.java*\n\nI kept for now the \"force-bzip\" logic in WriteLineDocTask but I would like to remove it - it is strange, and in any case LineDocSource would only auto-detect bzip input format if WriteLineDocTask was able to auto-detect bzip output format. Removing it will also simplify StreamUtils. Any opinions on removing this \"force-bzip\" option?\n",

Any opinions on removing this \"force-bzip\" option?\n\n+1 (you mean the bzip.compression property in WLDT right?). I think that it's reasonable to request the user to specify an output file with .bz2 extension if he wants bzip compression. I don't see how it will simplify StreamUtils though, but I trust you :) (perhaps you meant it will simplify WLDT?)",

In StreamUtils you have \"<b>.bz</b>\" -- it should be \"<b>.bz2</b>\"\n\nGood catch!\nFixed.\n\nbq. +1 (you mean the bzip.compression property in WLDT right?). \n\nYes.\n\nbq. I think that it's reasonable to request the user to specify an output file with .bz2 extension if he wants bzip compression. \n\nGreat, I removed it.\n\nbq. I don't see how it will simplify StreamUtils though, but I trust you :) (perhaps you meant it will simplify WLDT?)\n\nIt allowed to keep just one of the two variations of StreamUtils.outputStream(). WLDT and the tests became simpler as well.\n\nAttaching updated patch.\n(again first apply that svn mv...)",
