    "description": "If you pass an index that has a segment > maxMergeDocs or maxMergeSize\nto addIndexesNoOptimize, it throws an IllegalArgumentException.\n\nBut this check isn't reasonable because segment merging can easily\nproduce segments over these sizes since those limits apply to each\nsegment being merged, not to the final size of the segment produced.\n\nSo if you set maxMergeDocs to X, build up and index, then try to add\nthat index to another index that also has maxMergeDocs X, you can\neasily hit the exception.\n\nI think it's being too pedantic; I plan to just remove the checks for\nsizes.",
