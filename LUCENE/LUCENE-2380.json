In my opinion, it should be an array of byte[], where each byte[] is allocated with the termsize from the enums BytesRef and copied over - this is. This is no problem, as the terms need to be replicated either way, as the BytesRef from the enum is reused. The only problem is that byte[] is mising the cool bytesref methods like utf8ToString() that may be needed by consumers.\n\ngetStrings and getStringIndex should be deprecated. We cannot emulate them using BytesRef.utf8ToString, as the String[] arrays are raw and allow no wrapping. If FieldCache would use accessor methods and not raw arrays, we would not have that problem...",

Now that we are in control, it would be a crime not not share the byte[]\nSeems like one should pass in a BytesRef to be filled in... that would be most efficient for people doing simple stuff like compare docid1 to docid2.  Returning a reused BytesRef could also work (as TermsEnum does) but it's less efficient for anything needing a state of more than 1 BytesRef since it then requires copying.\n\nWe can further save space by putting the length as a vInt in the byte[] - most would be a single byte.\nThen we just need an int[] as an index into the byte[]... or potentially packed ints.\n\nWe'll also need an implementation that can span multiple byte[]s for larger than 2GB support.  The correct byte[] to look into is then simply a function of the docid (as is done in Solr's UnInvertedField).\n\nWe could possibly play games with the offsets into the byte[] too - encode as a delta against the average instead of an absolute offset.  So offset = average_size * ord + get_delta(ord)",

So getBytes(docid) returns a reused BytesRef with offset and length of the requested term. For native types we should also go away from arrays and only provide accessor methods. Java is so fast and possiby inlines the method call. So for native types we could also use a FloatBuffer or ByteBuffer or whatever from java.nio.",

The drop on Win7 was only 20% though.\n\nSo: you can't always depend on the JVM being able to inline stuff for you, and it seems very hard to determine when it can.\nThis obviously has implications for the lucene benchmarker too.\n",

This should be quite a bit more RAM efficient too, for US ascii content since each character would then use 1 byte not 2.",
