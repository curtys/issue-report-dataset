Can't we simply do a\nbetter job seeding Random (eg with System.nanoTime()), instead?\n\nOr, make the usage of j.l.management dynamic?\n\nNote that this was added for LUCENE-2421, which was only to make\nsure our tests don't make conflicting locks.  It seems very unlikely\na \"real\" app would hit this (the lock files live in the index dir).  Maybe\nwe can fix it for tests only (eg swap in different impl when tests are\nrunning...)?\n",

This philosophy\napplies all across lucene sources, but especially to our very low\nlevel APIs like locking.\n\nSo... is/was j.l.management really the only way to solve this problem?\nWouldn't seeding with System.nanoTime also suffice?\n\nHmm... maybe a better solution is to stop acquiring a test lock\naltogether?  Only NativeFSLockFactory does this..., and it's actually\nrather silly, because we acquireTestLock when .makeLock is called,\nyet, the caller who called .makeLock will presumably shortly\nthereafter call .obtain on that lock and will at that point see an\nexception if there are issues with native locks on the current\nfilesystem.\n\nNote that we are only trying to generate a unique name for the *test*\nlock that the lock factory acquires to verify locking will work.  As\nfar as I know, no app has ever hard a problem with this, ie, this is a\ntest-only problem.  In fact, even reading through LUCENE-2421 again, I\ndon't get why our tests are running simultaneous tests sharing the\nsame lock directory?  Shai do you remember which specific tests cause\nproblems?  And if the test lock was a problem, why then was the real\nlock not a problem?\n",

The workaround is to use another custom LockFactory or SimpleFSLockFactory, but Fixing NativeFSLockFactroy will help.\n\nThanks,\nSurinder",
