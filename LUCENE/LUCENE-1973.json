One more occurence of my famous MethodSupport dies :( :)\n\nDo not wonder about the assertTrue() -> assertEquals() changes in TestSimilarity, but I had a problem at the beginning to find out why the score() was not 1.0 for the PhraseQuery (I just removed the collection idf() method from the SimpleSimilarity, but had to reimplement is using Eplanations()). And this both in BW branch and trunk.\n\nWill commit soon when *all* tests have been run.",

Without this setting, one have to craete the TopFieldDocCollector manually, what we not really want the user to do (because the static ctor params are source of confusion). If I had known the method before, I would use it in my IndexSearcher and set it to true, if needed. It is a per instance setting, so it is no static hell affected (like anywhere else).\n\nShould we simply document it correct and un-deprecate in 2.9? It makes life easier.\n\n+1 from my side.",

You will find more of them, but they are needed for index compatibility and must stay until 3.9 or are simply markers for other things to remove some time (non-public methods or fields).\n\nSo we are close to 3.0 release :-)",
