The option exists specifically for apps like lucene... see the description from the man page!!!!\n\nThe intention behind the man page is not for the part of the app that manages the *index* itsself (like Lucene) - it is for the part of the app, that *reads* files *to index them* (so that would be the app that uses lucene and e.g. uses TIKA to read all files, this one should set noatime). The idea is to not mark the file as \"accessed\" when the virus scanner or the KDE/gnome file system browser indexes it.\n\nSimon is right about setting it as a mount option.",

I had no idea linux lets you turn off atime per file desriptor!\n\nIt's ridiculous that the OS maintains an atime on our index files.\n\nUwe, I agree about the intention of the man page (so eg back when contrib/benchmark used to write 10,000 files to run its tests, and then index them, we could've seen a big speedup :) ), but still it can't hurt to also turn it off when opening the index files for reading.\n\nI think atime is updated per-read not just at open (http://lkml.org/lkml/1998/12/14/81) though I'm not sure.  Even so, it's presumably cached in the OS's write buffer and then only flushed periodically, so I don't think we'll see sizable gains here.  But every bit counts so I think we should do it.",

It seems that lots of distributions use relatime which is smarter about it see: http://lwn.net/Articles/244829/\n\nwe should really document that on the wiki so that folks can check what their dist does or by default set it to noatime.\n\nsimon",

This flag is intended for use by indexing or backup programs, where its use can significantly reduce the amount of disk activity. This flag may not be effective on all filesystems. One example is NFS, where the server maintains the access time.\n\nSo we should do this in our linux-specific DirectIOLinuxDirectory.\n\nSeparately (offtopic), it would be better if this was a LinuxDirectory that only uses O_DIRECT when it should :)\nIt would be nice to think about an optional modules/native for common platforms similar to what tomcat provides\nIts easier to test directories like this now (-Dtests.directory)...\n",
