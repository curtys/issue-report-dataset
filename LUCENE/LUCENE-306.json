    "description": "The problem is if you search on \"ca??\", the hit includes 'cat', 'CA', \netc, while the user only wants 4 letter words start with CA, such as \n'card', 'cash', to be returned. This happens only when multiple '?' at \nthe end of search pattern. The solution is to check if the word that is \nmatching against search pattern ends while there is still '?' left. If \nthis is the case, match should return false.\n\nAttached is the patch code I generated use 'diff'\n********************************************************************\n\n--- WildcardTermEnum.org\t2004-05-11 11:42:10.000000000 -0400\n+++ WildcardTermEnum.java\t2004-11-08 14:35:14.823610500 -0500\n@@ -132,6 +132,10 @@\n             }\n             else\n             {\n+\t      //to prevent \"cat\" matches \"ca??\"\n+\t      if(wildchar == WILDCARD_CHAR){\n+\t\treturn false;\n+\t      }\t      \n               // Look at the next character\n               wildcardSearchPos++;\n             }\n**********************************************************************",
