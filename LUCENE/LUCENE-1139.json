    "description": "I've worked out a few small improvements to contrib/benchmark:\n\n  * Refactored the common code in Open/CreateIndexTask that sets the\n    configuration for the IndexWriter.  This also fixes a bug in\n    OpenIndexTasks that prevented you from disabling flushing by RAM.\n\n  * Added a new config property for LineDocMaker:\n\n      doc.reuse.fields=true|false\n\n    which turns on/off reusing of Field/Document by LineDocMaker.\n    This lets us measure performance impact of sharing Field/Document\n    vs not, and also turn it off when necessary (eg if you have your\n    own consumer that uses private threads).\n\n  * Added merge.scheduler & merge.policy config options.\n\n  * Added param for OptimizeTask, which expects an int and calls\n    optimize(maxNumSegments) with that param.\n\n  * Added param for CloseIndex(true|false) -- if you pass false that\n    means close the index, aborting any running merges\n",
