            "body": "Optimized patch:\n- removed useless interfaces from attribute (inherited)\n- removed interface @Override (die, sunbug, die)\n- equals in AttributeImpls should always compare same implementations (not like copyTo() which can copy to different impl)\n- replaced global field runAutomaton by only the attribute, which now contains List<ByteRunAutomaton>. This is list is also updated now when maxDistance raises, so the automatons are never genated 2 times. This should improve switches between maxDistance. So the whole array is no longer replaced.\n\nAll tests pass.",

As the impl class must be public for AS to load it, the trick is to wrap it in a private static inner class.\n\nBy that the attributes are invisible to both code and javadocs. You can only load and instantiate the class by reflection or when you have a already loaded Class object of the attribute.\n\nAlso added javadocs for ctor (forgot that on MTQ per-seg rewrite issue) and made attribute impl final.\n\nI think it's ready to commit.
