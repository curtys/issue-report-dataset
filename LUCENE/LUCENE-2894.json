Any idea what it takes to integrate this with an ant task for javadocs?\n\nNothing special at this moment. So the author of javadoc should know where prettify script is:\n\n{code}\n<script src=\"../../../../prettify.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n{code}\n\nHe should write it in another javadoc:\n\n{code}\n<script src=\"../../../../../../../prettify.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n{code}\n\nI don't like it...\n\n(where prettify.js needs to be copied from somewhere (dev-tools? for example) to output dir of javadoc by ant task.)",
