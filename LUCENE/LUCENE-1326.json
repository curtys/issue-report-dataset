            "body": "\nYou're welcome and thanks for the quick response!\n\nBy the way, our specific issue was with DeflaterOutputStream.close(). It only calls end() on the deflater if it created it itself, so this;\n\ndos = new DeflaterOutputStream();\ntry {\n ...\n} finally {\n  dos.close();\n}\n\nfrees all resources but this does not;\n\ndos = new DeflaterOutputStream(new Deflater(Deflater.BEST_COMPRESSION, true));\ntry {\n ...\n} finally {\n  dos.close();\n}\n\nYou have to call Deflater.end() *yourself* if you make one when you pass it in. close() is not sufficient.\n\n\n",

As documented here;\n\nhttp://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=4797189\n\nThe non-heap memory that the native zlib code uses is not freed in a timely manner.\n\nFieldsWriter appears safe as no exception can be thrown between the Deflater's creation and end() as it uses a ByteArrayOutputStream\n\nFieldsReader, however, is not safe. In the event of a DataFormatException the call to end() will not occur.",
