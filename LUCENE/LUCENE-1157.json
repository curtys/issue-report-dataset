I.e. where to put the generated file?\n\nOne option is to add it to svn (when the release is closed), and link to it e.g. like this:\nhttp://svn.apache.org/viewvc/lucene/java/branches/lucene_2_3/Changes.html?view=co\nBut then future changes to the branch are likely to forget updating this file...\n\nSteven, what do you think of this?",

And it could be linked to from everywhere that now links to CHANGES.txt.\n\nIn addition, the per-release documentation (maybe from the Overview page?) could link to a version of Changes.html that only includes changes up to the release in question.  AFAICT, the per-release documentation is created as part of the release process.\n\nThat leaves the question of whether to include HTML versions of CHANGES.txt for previous releases - my vote is to do so.\n\nThat makes 4 different classes of location for Changes.html:\n\n# Current trunk view, linked from developers' documentation. _(done)_\n# Latest release view, linked from the non-versioned site.\n# Per-release view for releases going forward - contains changes only up to the release.\n# Per-release view for previous releases - contains changes only up to the release.",
