            "body": "Uwe, when I first looked at your patch I thought that is a good idea but once I looked at the usecases of CharArraySet differentiating between matchVersion if the given set is an instance of CharArraySet is not idea IMO. Imagine you create an analyzer with CharArraySet the analyzer will use its own given version together with the copy method internally if the analyzer is created with a different version than the provided stopset (which is already a CharArraySet) copy could change the behavior due to the given version with is actually the matchVersion for the analyzer not for the set. I would leave the decision to the user if a copy with a different version is what the user wants. If the version should not be preserved and the set to copy is a charArraySet users should use the constructor directly. I will attach a patch shortly",

That was what my patch was doing to preserve this behaviour. \n\nthe CharArraySet did not have a Version before 3.1 so this code has never been released. Changing this behavior is fine and will not break anything though.\n\nsimon",
