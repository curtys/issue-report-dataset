            "body": "I think this makes sense though. sometimes like in your usecase MMap just fails with OOM and since we create the directory instance based on constants like 64bit platform, OS etc. we could make this optional. another option would be to simply use NIOFSDirectory no matter where we are. I don't think it is necessary to use FileSwitchDirectory for CheckIndex. Maybe you can add a commandline option and get a specific Dir impl if specified? NIO, MMAP & SimpleFS should be enough and use FSDirectory.open by default.",

It would be good to have some general command line parser for those comand line tools that work on indexes, so we don't have the same/similar code several times.\n\nFor me much more interesting is the problem you have with MMAP? Whats you Java VM / Lucene version and what's your complete command line to CheckIndex? How big is the index? What architecture are you using and which OS? Changing the chunk size is not needed in most cases, if it needs to we need complete configuration details to optimize auto detection.",

You certainly know my colleague Martijn, Solr/Lucene committer. I really like the open source world and the solr/lucene project. These are my contributions so far: SOLR-1499 and SOLR-2591. Just a few, but I would like to contribute as much as I can. Please,don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions.\nI assigned the issue to myself because I thought I was gonna work on it, but let me know if I made some mistakes.\nTomorrow I'll add more details about the MMAP and the OOM. \nThanks for your help and for your point of view about the issue, it would be great to do something more generic than I initially thought, I'll have a look at the code.\n\n",

The new option can have the following values (case insensitive): mmap, nio or simple. Any other value is ignored and considered as default (FSDirectory.open).\n\nI noticed a finally block used to close the directory inside IndexReader, but it's missing on the other two classes, wouldn't it be better to add it to CheckIndex and IndexUpgrader?",

Just an idea, this would make the CommandlineUtils obsolete and I think it could be useful... not sure what others think... uwe? \n\nbq. Forgot to mention that the patch applies to the 3x branch\n\nusually we (I) only provide a patch against trunk since we do a merge when we backport so a patch doesn't help very often. So it'd be better if you'd use trunk to create patches.\n\nsimon",
