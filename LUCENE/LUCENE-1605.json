    "description": "Recently I needed the ability to efficiently compute subsets of a BitVector. The method is:\n  public BitVector subset(int start, int end)\nwhere \"start\" is the starting index, inclusive and \"end\" is the ending index, exclusive.\n\nAttached is a patch including the subset method as well as relevant unit tests.",
