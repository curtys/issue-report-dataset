    "description": "If you re-use the same instance of SnapshotDeletionPolicy across a\nclose/open of your writer, and you had a snapshot open, it can still\nbe removed when the 2nd writer is opened.  This is because SDP is\ncomparing IndexCommitPoint instances.\n\nThe fix is to instead compare segments file names.\n\nI've also changed the inner class IndexFileDeleter.CommitPoint to be\nstatic so an instance of SnapshotDeletionPolicy does not hold\nreferences to IndexFileDeleter, DocumentsWriter, etc.\n\nSpinoff from here:\n\n  http://markmail.org/message/bojgqfgyxkkv4fyb\n",
