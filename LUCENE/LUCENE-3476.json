I don't think we should go to such\ngreat lengths to remove the sync'd from swapSearcher.\n\nThat sync is harmless in practice (it's uncontended unless the app\nscrews up and calls .close while another thread is calling\n.maybeReopen), and the changes necessary to make it truly lockless\nmakes SearcherManager's code quite a bit more complex.\n\nDon't get me wrong: it's an impressive feat of concurrent programming\nto make swapSearcher lock-free, but just because you can remove a sync\ndoesn't mean you should.\n\nBut we should still fix the original issue, for those apps that do\nmess up: can't we simply move the swapSearcher inside the\ntry/finally/success?\n",

I personally don't like this unchecked exception in swapSearcher but since its internal that's ok. I had to make close synced too to make sure we can call close more than once (this is what the interface says in its jdocs).  ",
