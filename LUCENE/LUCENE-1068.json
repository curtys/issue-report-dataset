            "body": "I've found a way to do it (I think):\nI've added a new type called ACRONYM_DEP that identifies the old ACRONYMs and fixed the current ACRONYM to identify proper ones.\nI also marked ACRONYM_DEP as deprecated.\nI added code to StandardTokenizer to set the type of a token to HOST if the type returned is ACRONYM_DEP. This behavior can be changed if you think the type should be set to ACRONYM, in case there are applications that count on the Token type.\n\nI wrote these 4 lines of code to verify it works:\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n\t\tparse(\"www.abc.com.\");\n\t\tparse(\"www.abc.com\");\n\t\tparse(\"I.B.M.\");\n\t}\n\n\tpublic static void parse(String text) throws Exception {\n\t\tAnalyzer analyzer = new StandardAnalyzer();\n\t\tTokenStream ts = analyzer.tokenStream(\"content\", new StringReader(text));\n\t\tToken t;\n\t\twhile ((t = ts.next()) != null) {\n\t\t\tSystem.out.println(t);\n\t\t}\n\t}\nAnd the output is: \n(www.abc.com.,0,12,type=<HOST>)\n(www.abc.com,0,11,type=<HOST>)\n(ibm,0,6,type=<ACRONYM>)",

            "body": "The previous patch I put was incorrect since it would still break existing applications. The current patch does:\n1. Introduces a new type ACRONYM_DEP which is deprecated and recognizes the old ACRONYM format.\n2. Fixes ACRONYM to recognize LETTER + \".\" (LETTER + \".\")+.\n3. Added a public member to StandardTokenizer and StandardAnalyzer replaceDepAcronym which can be set if the application would like the deprecated acronym format to be treated as ACRONYM or HOST. The default behavior, if not set is to recognize the old ACRONYM as HOST.\n\nThis is how it should be used:\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n\t\tparse(\"www.abc.com.\", false);\n\t\tparse(\"www.abc.com.\", true);\n\t\tparse(\"www.abc.com\", true);\n\t\tparse(\"I.B.M.\", true);\n\t}\n\n\tpublic static void parse(String text, boolean replaceDepAcronym) throws Exception {\n\t\tStandardAnalyzer analyzer = new StandardAnalyzer();\n    analyzer.replaceDepAcronym = replaceDepAcronym;\n\t\tTokenStream ts = analyzer.tokenStream(\"content\", new StringReader(text));\n\t\tToken t;\n\t\twhile ((t = ts.next()) != null) {\n\t\t\tSystem.out.println(t);\n\t\t}\n\t}\nAnd here is the output:\n(wwwabccom,0,12,type=<ACRONYM>)\n(www.abc.com.,0,12,type=<HOST>)\n(www.abc.com,0,11,type=<HOST>)\n(ibm,0,6,type=<ACRONYM>)\n\nThe member is marked deprecated so we can remove it in the next release. Applications that would like to new behavior need to do nothing, and therefore will not be impacted once we remove that member. Applications that want the old behavior need to explicitly set it and in the next major release remove it.\n\nI think that solves it. How should I proceed?",

I'll check if there's a way to define precedence in JFlex, i.e., first detect NUM, then HOST (as every floating number is a HOST).\nAnother option would be to set HOST do detect series of xxx.yyy.(zzz .)+, meaning aaa.bbb won't be a HOST, but aaa.bbb.ccc will be. Do you see any problem with that? Are you aware of hosts that are of the form aa.bb?",
