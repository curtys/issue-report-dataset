    "description": "Currently there are four methods named Field.Text(). As those methods have \nthe same name and a very similar method signature, everyone will think these \nare just convenience methods that do the same thing. But they behave \ndifferently: the one that takes a Reader doesn't store the data, the one that \ntakes a String does. I know that this is documented, but it's still not a nice \nAPI. Methods that behave differently should have diffent names. The attached \npatch deprecates two of the old methods and adds two new ones named \nField.StoredText(). I think this is much easier to understand from the \nprogrammer's point-of-view and will help avoid bugs.",
