This is useless and most scorers ignored it or populated it with garbage.\nScorers themselves, know if they need a sim or not (e.g. BooleanScorer uses only the top-level SimilarityProvider for coord).\n\nall lucene/contrib/solr tests pass, i also added a simple unit test.\n",

            "body": "I like this flexibility - allowing different scoring parameters for different fields. \n\nWondering though - would it be nicer to keep original name *Similarity* and just change the way it is created and used to be field specific...?\n\nFor this, should deprecate Similarity methods taking a field/name param and introduce new ones without it - hmm.. the class would then have 3 deprecated methods: \n\n* scorePayload()\n* lengthNorm() (which anyway is already deprecated)\n* computeNorm()\n\nIs that too bad?\n\nFor FieldSimilarity (and for the new method in Similarity if deciding to keep that name after all) can we get rid of the first parameter fieldName from computeNorm() and scorePayload(), or are they used in a way I am missing even when one knows that the similarity is for certain (or all) field?\n\nIn the new class FS (if kept) I think the deprecated lengthNorm() can be removed?\n\nAlso, since Similarity (or FS) is becoming field aware, perhaps add a method *getFieldName()* - it can return null or ANY in case there is no dedicated similarity for that field... Hmm... If the logic employed is this \"For fields F1, F2 return Sim1, for F3, F4 return Sim2, for all other fields return Sim3, then it is less simple, still, the similarity provider called with a field name can pass it to the Similarity object created and that in turn would be able to return it... just thinking out loud here... should Sim be aware of for which field it was created, so that no need to pass it as parameter in its methods in case this is ever important?",

            "body": "bq. Is that too bad?\n\nwell my concern about the deprecated methods is we get into the hairy backwards compat situation...\nwe already had issues with this with Similarity.\n\nIt might be ok to essentially fix Similarity to be the way we want for 4.0 (break it) since its an expert API anyway.\nThis patch was just a quick stab...\nI definitely agree with you about the name though, i prefer Similarity.\n\nbq. should Sim be aware of for which field it was created, so that no need to pass it as parameter in its methods in case this is ever important?\n\nWell honestly I think what you are saying is really needed for the future... but I would prefer to actually delay that until a future patch :)\n\nMaking an optimized TermScorer is becoming more and more complicated, see the one in the bulkpostings branch for example. Because of this,\nits extremely tricky to customize the scoring with good performance. I think the score caching etc in term scorer needs to be moved out of TermScorer,\ninstead the responsibility of calculating the score should reside in Similarity, including any caching it needs to do (which is really impl dependent).\nBasically Similarity needs to be responsible for score(), but let TermScorer etc deal with enumerating postings etc.\n\nFor example, we now have the stats totalTermFreq/totalCollectionFreq by field for a term, but you can't e.g. take these and make a \nLanguage-modelling based scorer, which you should be able to do *right now*, except for limitations in our APIs.\n\nSo in a future issue I would like to propose a patch to do just this, so that TermScorer, for example is more general. Similarity would need to be able\nto 'setup' a query (e.g. things like IDF, building score caches for the query, whatever), and then also score an individual document.\n\nIn the flexible scoring prototype this is what we did, but we went even further, where a Similarity is also responsible for 'setting up' a searcher, too.\nSo that means, its responsible for managing norm byte[] (in that patch, you only had a byte[] norms, if you made it in your Similarity yourself).\nI think long term that approach is definitely really interesting, but I think we can go ahead and make scoring a lot more flexible in tiny steps \nlike this without rewriting all of lucene in one enormous patch... and this is safer as we can benchmark performance each step of the way.\n",

Nice.\nAlso, perhaps what seems to be like an inflation of Similarity objects (per query per field) is one more good reason to keep the field name params for now.\n{quote}\n\nWell I'm not totally sure how we want to do it, but definitely I think we want to split Scorer's calculations and finding matches as you say,\nand also split Weight's calculations and \"resource management\"\n\nFor example, TermWeight today has a PerReaderTermState, which contains all the information you need to calculate the \"setup\" portion\nwithout doing any real I/O (e.g. docFreq, totalTermFreq, totalCollectionFreq, ...) So maybe this is the right thing to pass to Similarity's \"query setup\".\n\nThe Weight then would just be responsible for managing termstate and creating a Scorer...\n\nI think also the Similarity needs to be fully responsible for Explanations... but most users wouldn't have to interact with this I think.\nInstead I think typically their \"base class\" (TFIDFSimilarity or whatever it is) would typically provide this, based on the methods and API\nit exposes: tf(), idf(), but this would allow us to also have other fully-fleshed out base classes like BM25Similarity, that you can extend\nand tune based on the parameters that make sense to it.\n\nAnyway these are just some thoughts, first I'm going to adjust the patch to keep our existing name \"Similarity\".\n",

Would it be cleaner to have a new class DefaultSimilarityProvider which would return DefaultSimilarity? not sure, but thought it's worth mentioning.\n\nI went back and forth on this one... it could go either way? But since the default does the same thing for every field, I thought\nit made sense... what do you think? We could always revisit it too later, if we later prefer these to be separate.\n\n{quote}\njavadoc in line 78:\n\"In general, this should not be used.\"\nIs that so? I would like to believe that in general the default is pretty good.\n{quote}\n\nIn this case, I should have been more verbose... what I meant here is that 'in general, code should not call this static method, instead it should \nrespect the SimilarityProvider set on IndexSearcher [getSimilarityProvider()]...'. This is just the default exposed for internal purposes: just to\nhave a single immutable default instance for MemoryIndex, InstantiatedIndex, IndexWriterConfig, IndexSearcher... but if someone writes\na custom Query for example, they should be using IndexSearcher.getSimilarityProvider(), and not this static.\n\nI can update the javadocs to be a little bit more verbose for this method, as I would like to discourage its use... its essentially just like\nusing Similarity.getDefault() before, which I tried to cleanup across lucene.\n",
