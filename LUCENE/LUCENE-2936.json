            "body": "Koji: the issue is the document boost of zero.\n\nbecause of this, the explanation does not indicate a match by default (see Explanation.java):\n{noformat}\n  /**\n   * Indicates whether or not this Explanation models a good match.\n   *\n   * <p>\n   * By default, an Explanation represents a \"match\" if the value is positive.\n   * </p>\n   * @see #getValue\n   */\n  public boolean isMatch() {\n    return (0.0f < getValue());\n  }\n{noformat}\n\nSeparately, we should decide what to do about norm values of zero. In my opinion, norm values of zero should not necessarily decode to a floating point value of zero (we might want to adjust our norm decoder by default to not do this). \n\nOtherwise, in addition to your problem, the search degrades into a pure boolean ranking model (as TF and IDF are completely zeroed out).\n\nThis is really unlikely with the default relevance ranking (unless you use a boost of zero or similar), but is possible e.g. if you use a different SmallFloat quantization. I raised this issue on LUCENE-1360 where if you were to use this \"short field\" quantization on a large document, what should we do?\n\nSo in my opinion, we should consider adjusting the NORM_TABLE in Similarity so that if the norm happens to be zero, it does not decode to a float of zero. This will have no impact on performance as its a statically calculated table.\n",

Hoss's assumption is correct because the problem was found at customer site when they used a BooleanQuery containing PhraseQueries (term query on 1-gram fields)\n\nsure .. but to be clear: the crux of the issue was really a bug in PhraseQuery -- it wasn't correctly identifying where there was a match/non-match (independently of when the score was zero/non-zero).\n\nthe reason my initial attempt at exposing the bug (by setting an index boost of 0 on some of the fields) didn't cause any of the existing TestSimpleExplanations.testP* to fail was because of the bugs i mentioned in in CheckHits (it was naively looking at hte score to verify when an explanation was for a match/non-match) so the bug didn't show up in the testP* methods until i fixed that.  It did show up in the \"testMultiFieldBQofPQ*\" methods i added because BooleanQuery's explain logic was actually modifying the score of it's explanation based on the match value of the explanation for the sub-queries (because of coord)",
