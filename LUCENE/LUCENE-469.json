If they did, well, they're experts, right? :)\n\nThis is my complete patch to correct the problem and I do indeed propose to add a field maxScore to TopDocs that is used in Hits to normalize the results at as the very last step.\n\nAll the TestCases pass after applying this patch.",

            "body": "Thanks Luc!\na couple of things:\n\n- changing expert level search functions to not normalize.  +1 from me, but I'd like to hear from some others on a change like this.\n\n- TopDocs and TopFieldDocs are public... this patch changes the constructors.  Although this is a great way to test if we got all the cases within Lucene, if anyone created their own instances outside lucene, it would break backward compatibility.  This is beyond expert level though... so perhaps it shouldn't worry us.\n\n- I'm not sure if the MultiSearcher implementation is correct for other Sorts.\n  FieldDocSortedHitQueue.getMaxScore() is only the max score of docs inserted... I think you need to reference  docs.maxScore() rather than relying on the  FieldDocSortedHitQueue in this case, right?\n",

(FYI, the score normalization \"feature\" was added in the early days of Lucene when lots of folks seemed to find scores greater than 1.0 disturbing.)\n",

            "body": "I discovered the problem in my production system a while ago, assumed it would have been fixed in 1.9 and noticed it wasn't.\n\nI created test cases to reproduce it and used them to find and eliminate the problem.  I didn't pay much attention to compatibility issues yet.\n\nI backported the patches to 1.4.3 now, tested it and put it in production.\nI'll post those 1.4.3 version of the patches later\n\n- TopDocs and TopFieldDocs are indeed public.  I could add the old constructor again with a @deprecated tag that sets maxScore to 1.0\n\n- Other Sorts: You are right, I made a mistake by concentrating too much on the Sort.RELEVANCE case.  A similar problem exists for ParallelMultiSearcher.\n\n- I am also in favour of making maxScore private with public accessors.  I only made it public because the other members where public...\n\nI'll post corrected patches later today...\n",

Those constructors where package private, so they couldn't be used by derived classes anyway.  So I think risk of breaking backwards compatibility for existing applications by changing these classes is fairly low.\n",

(Assuming the highest score was>1.0)\n\nHowever, for MultiSearcher and ParallelMultiSearcher, this normalization factor is applied *per index*, before merging the results together (the merge itself is ok though).\n\nAn example: if you use\nHits hits=multiSearcher.search(query, Sort.RELEVANCE);\nfor a MultiSearcher with two subsearchers, the first document will have score 1.0.\nThe next documents from the same subsearcher will have decreasing scores.\nThe first document from the other subsearcher will however have score 1.0 again !\n\nThe same applies for other Sort objects, but it is less visible.\n\nI will post a TestCase demonstrating the problem and suggested patches to solve it in a moment...",
