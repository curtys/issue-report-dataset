    "description": "I just hit this on LUCENE-1516, which returns a cloned readOnly\nreaders from IndexWriter.\n\nThe problem is, when cloning, we create a new [thin] cloned\nSegmentReader for each segment.  FieldCache keys directly off this\nobject, so if you clone the reader and do a search that requires the\nFieldCache (eg, sorting) then that first search is always very slow\nbecause every single segment is reloading the FieldCache.\n\nThis is of course a complete showstopper for LUCENE-1516.\n\nWith LUCENE-831 we'll switch to a new FieldCache API; we should ensure\nthis bug is not present there.  We should also fix the bug in the\ncurrent FieldCache API since for 2.9, users may hit this.\n",
