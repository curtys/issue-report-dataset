And there's no documented or implied contract I'm breaking with this change in increment gap behavior.  I'd be really surprised to learn that anyone actually depends on the current behavior.  When I went into the code I was figuring it might smartly only apply the increment gap if the offset *changed* from one value to another but it doesn't even do that, and so the current algorithm strikes me as a bit arbitrary.  Seems like a safe one-liner commit to me.  But then I'm biased as the reporter ;-)",

Seems like we should also fix offset to always add the gap?\n\nWanna cons up a patch...?",

            "body": "Always adding the position increment is good but insufficient to solve my problem.\n\nA new patch rectifies the followup situation I reported inadvertently to LUCENE-2668 that I should have said here.  The jist is that DocInverterPerField _conditionally_ decrements the position and then always increments it, and this is problematic for attempting to keep position increments across several multi-value fields aligned (using an analyzer setting posIncr to 0) when the first value generates no tokens (either blank or stop words).  Mike McCandless pointed out that the unfortunate existing logic had to do with preventing the position from becoming -1 which doesn't work with payloads -- LUCENE-1542.  \n\nMy new patch here doesn't even have a pre-decrement nor post-increment and thus I find the code easier to follow.  It ignores the provided position increment of the first token (typically 1), voiding the need to shift them back and forth.  There is one oddity included here and that is I always add 1 to the position increment _gap_ (i.e. between values).  With this oddity included, all the tests pass (except for the test for this very issue, which I correct in this patch)  --yay!  Without this oddity, a handful of tests failed that depended on the first token adding one to the position.  My +1 up at the value loop can be seen as actually enforcing that the first token's position is 1, and also adding a +1 for when there is no token for a value (critical for aligning multiple fields).  Perhaps this +1 should happen at a different line number to be less confusing but the end result should be the same.\n\nI expect for many people this is very confusing, especially if you're not knee deep in this subject as I am presently.  Mike, hopefully you're understanding what I'm up to here.  The tests pass, remember.",

Maybe, instead of that +1 inside IW, we change the default posIncrGap to 1?\n\nI had the +1 for the gap (i.e. between values) level because I was trying to get a blank value (or a value consisting of stop words) to bump the position counter as well.  I've been tinkering with this a bit more and I realize now that I can still achieve my aims without doing that, but it's still necessary to ignore the very first position increment of the very first value -- only.  See the new patch.  I think the result now should be even more amenable to others (i.e. is least disruptive) since anyone messing with the position increment of the first token of subsequent values will still be honored.\n\nbq. Can you spell out examples of how the indexed positions will change w/ this patch - I'm having trouble visualizing this. EG for a single valued field, multi-valued, etc.\n\nA single valued field is unaffected.  The first emitted token (if there are any at all) will remain at position 0 no matter what the analyzer does.  This is also true for the first value of a multi-valued field if there is any.\n\nFor multi-valued fields, it is now always the case that the first token of subsequent values (e.g. not the first value) will be the previous position (0 if none) + the gap + the first position increment of this value (typically 1).  This is consistent and sensible.  Formerly,\nif the first value was a blank value (or a value consisting of stop words), then you'd get 1 less than what you get now.  I hope the test I modified as part of this patch makes this more clear; I had to increment the tested positions by 1.\n\nAs I said before, I also think that the code is more clear since it no longer has that conditional pre-decrement and post increment of the position that was probably only understood by you.  And I did away with the weird \"+1\" at the gap in my previous patch.\n\nbq. Man I really want to get this logic out of indexer and into the analysis chain (LUCENE-2450 enables this). How multi-valued streams should handle the transition from one value to another shouldn't be inside the indexer... and maybe (someday) tokens should store their position (not the gap) so we don't have this cryptic logic inside the indexer..\n\nThat sounds great.  There are other strategies of messing with position increments that I simply can't do without hacking this code further.  For example, it would be neat if the first token of a value could be devised to start at posIncGap*valueIndex (ex: 0, 1000, 2000, ...) so that Span queries could determine which value index a term matched against by looking at it's position (ex: 3092: divide by 1000, drop remainder, add 1: the 4th value ).",

It seems to only make sense to put multiple *independent* values in a multi-valued field, not ones that are \"continuations\" of each other. By definition if they are continuations of each other, I think its better to index the whole thing as single-valued... and you have complete control of the positions within your tokenstream.\n",

All existing tests pass.  On the basis of that alone, I'm hopeful that you, Michael, and other committers are amenable to applying this patch.\n\nI acknowledge I could try to operate completely within a single value and thereby have more control over the position increments.

My suggestion is that if you have values like this with position dependencies, they are really one single value, not independent values, and don't belong in a multivalued-field.\n\nMy use-case is not like your example.  The value at index x has no relation to values before or after it in the same field.  It _does_ have a relationship to a separate multi-valued field's value at the same value index.  With this patch and an analyzer that sets all position increments to 0, all tokens for the same value index across both fields will have the same token position.\n\nbq. (me)    For my problem space, I'm willing to sacrifice the ability to do phrase queries.\n\nbq. Right, but my concern is that other users are not.  I don't think we should discard the first token's position increment value completely, will the QueryParser do this too?\n\nThe fact that my entire solution (for which this patch is a subset) can't do phrases is not evident in this patch.  Perhaps I should have kept my overall use case a secret so as not to cloud the purpose of this patch.  This patch is about generating predictable/intuitive/sensible (in my opinion) position values, particularly at the very start of a field.  I hope you would share my opinion if you apply the patch and examine the results such as what the test case the patch modifies does.\n\nIn my opinion (and apparently Mike McCandless -- \"I like the idea of disregarding the posIncrGap of the first token.\") I disagree.  The point of a position increment gap is only meaningful _between_ values.  It's meaningless for the first token.  At your suggestion I looked in QueryParser.java to look for problems that may have to do with the position increment.  I don't see any problems that would be introduced by this patch.  For convenient reference here, the position increment is grabbed at line 608:\n{code:java}\nint positionIncrement = (posIncrAtt != null) ? posIncrAtt.getPositionIncrement() : 1;\nif (positionIncrement != 0) {\n  positionCount += positionIncrement;\n} else {\n  severalTokensAtSamePosition = true;\n}\n{code}\n\nThe ensuing logic seems pretty sane to me (albeit complicated).  The only thing in here that could arguably be improved is line 645:\n{code:java}\nif (positionCount == 1 || (!quoted && !autoGeneratePhraseQueries)) {\n{code}\nI think the \"== 1\" should be \"<= 1\" just in case there's some intentional oddities in the analyzer that 99.9% of people wouldn't ever do.  I'm in the exception case.  But I have a different query time analyzer so I don't care that much.\n",

            "body": "Yes, the check could move outside the loop.  I don't think so for the \"correct < 0\" but whatever.  And the Highlight test fails because the test is based off of a multi-valued field in which the first value is blank, thus triggering the subsequent positions to be off by one from the former behavior.\nA small readability improvement might be to set fieldState.position to -1 instead of decrementing it because that is exactly the intended effect, which is more clear.\n\nFYI the observable change in behavior in this patch principally results from the \"firstToken\" boolean part of the condition in which the position is decremented.  Remove that part of the condition leaving simply i==0 and you get the former/existing behavior.\n\nUgh, I've thought about this issue way too much and I'm suddenly having a change of opinion.  Arguably the current effect of positions is more consistent... it is as if the starting position (prior to looking at the position increment) is -1, no matter whether the first value has tokens or not.  I'm going to achieve my objectives for my project via your suggestion of a single field with a value separator and a custom analyzer.  It's a little hacky but I'll then have full control over the positions and the field isn't stored any way.  I wish I had the ability to control positions in the indexer here a bit more but the support really isn't there and won't be until perhaps LUCENE-2450, the issue Mike referenced.\n\nAs far as my patch goes, with the small modification to get the existing behavior, I think it's an improvement to readability over the current code.  I can submit an update if desired. ",

    "description": "I'm doing some fancy stuff with span queries that is very sensitive to term positions.  I discovered that the position increment gap on indexing is only applied between values when there are existing terms indexed for the document.  I suspect this logic wasn't deliberate, it's just how its always been for no particular reason.  I think it should always apply the gap between fields.  Reference DocInverterPerField.java line 82:\n\nif (fieldState.length > 0)\n          fieldState.position += docState.analyzer.getPositionIncrementGap(fieldInfo.name);\n\nThis is checking fieldState.length.  I think the condition should simply be:  if (i > 0).\nI don't think this change will affect anyone at all but it will certainly help me.  Presently, I can either change this line in Lucene, or I can put in a hack so that the first value for the document is some dummy value which is wasteful.",
