If DOT is specified to be US-ASCII, it should use a PrintWriter that is instantiated using US-ASCII as charset (PrintStream uses platform default, and that may be Big5 or other ugly things). In my opinion, the method should take a PrintWriter and a possible File/OutputStream method should be hardcoded to US-ASCII.",

We all should always feel free to fix anything!  Especially, newly created code should get lots of attention from others; the more the better.\n\nThis better dot formatting looks awesome!!  Keeping both options open seems good?  (Though, I lack intuition on when the non-layered (old way) option would be better... maybe we default to the new way?).",

As for the DOT: layered representation may cause arcs to overlap and be virtually impossible to read, so both reps. are useful, it just depends on the automaton. I'll correct it to Writer and commit in.",
