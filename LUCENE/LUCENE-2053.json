Sure, maybe today you can't Thread.interrupt a Lucene search, but maybe in the future we'll allow that and then this same exception should be thrown.\n\nI think it's cleaner to extend RuntimeException.  Right now (2.9) you get a RuntimeException, so extending IOException instead is more of a back compat break.\n\nI just wish InterruptedException had been non-checked from the get-go...",
