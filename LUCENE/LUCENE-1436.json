Are you thinking it's just very unlikely this is used by anything except BooleanScorer2?\n\nWe also have at least ReqOptSumScorer (and maybe others?) which is public.",

Note that in the follow-up issue to 1614 (the number is yet to be generated) I intend to change the logic in ReqExclScorer so that it conforms to the new semantics of DISI.\n\nWhy do we need to make this class package-private? Any particular reason besides not needing to worry about changes to back-compat in the future?",

            "body": "This should only affect external code that uses the ReqExclScorer class.\nFrom the amount of reactions on that so far I think such code probably does not exist.\n\nThe move to DocIdSetIterator (superclass of Scorer) can be done because no score values are used on the excluded part. This is only a consequence of the extraction of the DocIdSetIterator superclass from Scorer.\n\nSo I don't expect LUCENE-1614 or new semantics of DISI to collide with this.\nAlso, I don't expect LUCENE-1614 to collide with LUCENE-1345 that allows filter as clause to boolean query.\n\nSome time ago DisjunctionSumScorer was made private in a similar way.\n\nReqOptSumScorer could also be made package private, perhaps even at the same time as ReqExclScorer.\n\n\n",
