    "description": "I think OpenBitSet is trying to satisfy too many audiences, and it's\nconfusing/error-proned as a result.  It has int/long variants of many\nmethods.  Some methods require in-bound access, others don't; of those\nothers, some methods auto-grow the bits, some don't.  OpenBitSet\ndoesn't always know its numBits.\n\nI'd like to factor out a more \"focused\" bit set impl whose primary\ntarget usage is a cached Lucene Filter, ie a bit set indexed by docID\n(int, not long) whose size is known and fixed up front (backed by\nfinal long[]) and is always accessed in-bounds.\n",
