I have one more minor improvement (to make the randomRealistic more realistic).\nIll put up a patch.\n\nLong term (for another day another issue), I think we should actually refactor this stuff with LineDocs\nso that LineDocs can return 'synthetic' linedocs too, that way non-analysis tests can use this too.",
