We can put it in LTC(J4) and have tests that wish to create on-disk resources use it. JUnit guarantees the contents of this folder will be removed when the test is finished, and if the test did not close its resources properly, it will fail. It will save us some code, nothing we cannot develop on our own, as you suggest.",

Robert, how about if we use JUnit's TemporaryFolder (http://kentbeck.github.com/junit/javadoc/latest/org/junit/rules/TemporaryFolder.html)? \n\nHi Shai, I looked at this, but I don't think we should use it. I think we should keep a consistent API between LuceneTestCase and LuceneTestCase4J.\n\nBut this TemporaryFolder is too basic for our needs and does not support our usage of LuceneTestCase4J (where the index is created in @beforeClass and destroyed in @afterClass),\nit only supports removing the directory after each test METHOD.\n\nFurthermore, there is no way to tell junit where to put this TemporaryFolder. Right now ensure that tests don't stomp on each others feet by giving\nthem unique temp directories per-jvm, i would like to continue ensuring that any temporary data is placed there, not somewhere randomly on the users system.\nThis way all data created by 'ant test' is guaranteed to be removed in 'ant clean'.\n\n",
