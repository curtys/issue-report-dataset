Each of those terms is given the same position in the index.\n\nI'm attaching a binary distribution of the library (morfologik-stemming-1.5.0.jar), that needs to be placed in modules/analysis/morfologik/lib/ subdirectory.\nIt is also available as a [Maven artifact|http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.carrot2/morfologik-stemming/1.5.0].\n\nThe library is BSD-licensed and a dictionary uses data from [Polish dictionary for aspell/ispell/myspell (SJP.PL)|http://www.sjp.pl/slownik/en/], which is licensed under GPL, LGPL, MPL and CC SA licenses.\n\nThis is my first contribution to the Lucene project, so please be forgiving :)\nThanks to Dawid for help.\n\nRegards,\n  Micha\u0142\n",

            "body": "Hi Micha\u0142,\n\nThis patch looks great!\n\nI took a quick glance, here are a couple suggestions:\n* In the MorfologikFilter, I think we should implement reset(), first calling the superclass reset(), then clearing the stemsAcc list. This ensures that all of the filter's state is cleared before it is reused. Under normal operations, this should not be necessary, but some consumers in Lucene (e.g. LimitTokenCountFilter, and some similar code in the Highlighter), will only partially consume up to some point, then suddenly stop. By clearing this list in reset() we ensure that there is no chance any leftover stems will appear in the next stream.\n* because the data is licensed under MPL, I think we should explicitly list a hyperlink if possible to the source code used in the NOTICE.txt. I saw you included some wordage in LICENSE.txt but I think this should only say 'XYZ data is under this license, with the actual MPL license text. In the NOTICE.txt we should link to the source code I think... there is some more information on this under the section Category B: Reciprocal Licenses at http://www.apache.org/legal/3party.html\n",

Both dictionaries are nearly identical (they differ slightly in their convention of morphosyntactic annotations) and Morfeusz's dictionary could be compiled into an automaton for use with Morfologik.\n\nWhich way should we go?

There are minor differences or\n  missing surface forms in both dictionaries, as in here (mz - morfeusz, mk - morfologik):\n\nmz> hakersko\nmz> hakersko\u015b\u0107\nmz> hakersko\u015bci\nmz> hakersko\u015bci\u0105\nmz> hakersko\u015bciach\nmz> hakersko\u015bciami\nmz> hakersko\u015bciom\nmk> hakerstw\nmk> hakerstwa\n...\nmk> hakowa\u0142y\u015bmy\nmk> hakowa\u0144\nmk> hakowaniach\nmk> hakowaniami\nmk> hakowaniom\nmz> hakowato\u015b\u0107\nmz> hakowato\u015bci\nmz> hakowato\u015bci\u0105\nmz> hakowato\u015bciach\nmz> hakowato\u015bciami\nmz> hakowato\u015bciom\n{noformat}\n\nSo... the conclusion is pretty consistent with Zipf's law: both dictionaries have a fairly different coverage, even if they're quite large. We don't have a frequency dictionary for Polish, but I assume most of these surface forms are purely theoretical and occur super-rarely in practice. This said, I think we should use BOTH dictionaries -- after all there's no harm done if we overdo the lemmatization process a little bit, is there?\n\nSo... my proposal would be this: I'll integrate Morfeusz's dictionary in Morfologik (as an alternative dictionary one can load and use). \n\nEventually it would be probably sensible to limit the automaton for use in Lucene to store surface forms and lemmas only (no POS tags) and merge both dictionaries into a single automaton... but this can  be a future improvement.\n\n",

Implemented MorfologikFilter.reset that resets the stemsAcc, and added a test case that would fail in the absence of that implementation, which exhibits the behaviour mentioned by Robert.\n\n2. Updated modules/analysis/NOTICE.txt and modules/analysis/LICENSE.txt - Robert, is that what you meant, or do they need to include more information ?\n\n3. MorfologikFilter now uses an explicit pointer to not modify the stemsAcc on each pass - Dawid, do you think it's reasonable to optimize further and use directly a list returned by IStemmer.lookup (instead of copying with addAll) ? My concern is that (at least in current DictionaryLookup implementation) that list seems to be shared by distinct invocations of the lookup method, which would make the use of a specific IStemmer not applicable in thread-safe code.\n\n4. Removed explicit call to getStem().toString().\n\n\nAs for the new Morfologik version, I've been thinking it would be better to alter the constructors of MorfologikAnalyzer and MorfologikFilter to accept concrete IStemmer implementations, instead of a languageCode String as they do now. This way, org.apache.lucene.analysis.morfologik package wouldn't depend on current implementations of IStemmer (only on the interface), and also allowed future ones to be used without changing the package. What do you think ?\n\nThat could also solve the case of a custom attribute for POS tags (MorfologikPOSAttribute ?) : since a client would instantiate their IStemmer explicitly, they would know the meaning of the attribute's value. That doesn't take into account the DICTIONARY.COMBINED stemmer, but the same seems to apply to the Morfologik library itself (I mean, for a specific WordData from IStemmer.lookup there is no information on which of the internal concrete DictionaryLookup it comes from). Dawid - what do you think of that issue ?\n",

My concern is that (at least in current DictionaryLookup implementation) that list seems to be shared by distinct invocations of the lookup method, which would make the use of a specific IStemmer not applicable in thread-safe code.\n\nIStemmer implementations are not thread safe anyway, so there is no problem in reusing that list. In fact, the returned WordData objects are reused internally as well, so you can't store them either (this is done to avoid GC overhead). \n\nSo yes: I missed that, but you'll need to ensure IStemmer instances are not shared. This can be done in various ways (thread local, etc), but I think the simplest way to do it would be to instantiate PolishStemmer at the MorfologikFilter level. This is cheap (the dictionary is loaded once anyway). \n\nYou can then create two constructors in the analyzer -- one with PolishStemmer.DICTIONARY and one with the default (I'd suggest MORFOLOGIK). Exposing IStemmer constructor will do more harm than good -- thinking ahead is good, but in this case I don't think there'll be this many people interested in subclassing IStemmer (if anything, they'll plug into Lucene's infrastructure directly).\n\nA simple test case spawning 5 or 10 threads in a parallel executor and crunching stems on the same analyzer would also be nice to ensure we have everything correct wrt multithreading, but it's not that crucial if you don't have the time to write it.\n\nThanks!",
