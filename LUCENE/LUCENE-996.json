            "body": "\nso this changes the query syntax such that foo:{a TO z] and foo:[a TO z} are now legal ... the querysyntax docs should be modified to mention this in the patch as well.\n\none hitch: this seems to break backwards compatibility for anyone who has previously subclassed QueryParser and overridden the getRangeQuery(String, String, String, boolean) method ... if someone defines that method in their query parser, it will now never be called -- even if they don't take advantage of the new syntax.\n\noff the top of my head, one way to remain backwards compatible is to have a deprecated getRangeQuery(String, String, String, boolean) method which does the same thing it currently does, and have the new getRangeQuery(String, String, String, boolean, boolean) method call it if the booleans have the same value ... if they don't have the same value then do the new stuff.  document that people subclassing QueryParser that want to override RangeQueries only need to override the double boolean method.",

I don't think there is a nice way to cover all the bases here, but I've updated the code help alleviate the problem.\n\nI believe the only thing that isn't covered is parsing foo:{a TO bat] with useOldRangeQueries=false. Classes that extend will still get a query back, but it might not be what they expect.",

Looks pretty good now except that a contrib test fails - those that overrode the deprecated  protected Query getRangeQuery(String field, String part1, String part2, boolean inclusive) are being left out in the cold.\n\nOnce that is addressed, I think this patch looks pretty good.",
