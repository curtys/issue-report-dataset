            "body": "The fix is fine, but in my optinion the problem should be solved differently.\n\nI would like to make the rewrite method in MultiTermQuery final to prevent override. To correctly fix the issue, WildcardQuery only needs to return a PrefixTermEnum in its getEnum method. This is already fixed in Lucene 4.0.\n\nFrom looking at the code, SpanMultiTermQueryWrapper would not work correct in all cases, if the underlying query overwrites rewrite(), as the rewritten query would again have the wrong type.",

            "body": "Same patch: except I made MultiTermQuery's rewrite() final.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a good backwards break, it will only fix bugs in someone's code if they have a custom MultiTermQuery: its very tricky to override this (e.g. you must pass along boost, rewriteMethod, ...), and when you do, still might cause problems (like this Span issue).\n\nIts also much easier to just return a simpler enum.\n",
