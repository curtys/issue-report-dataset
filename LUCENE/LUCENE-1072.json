I plan to commit in a day or two.\n\nI added a unit test showing that indeed DocumentsWriter becomes\nunusable once it's hit a \"too long term\", then fixed the issue so the\nunit test passes.\n\nNow, if we encounter too-long terms in the doc we skip those terms but\ncontinue indexing the other acceptable terms from the doc, then throw\nthe IllegalArgumentException at the end after processing the full\ndocument.  So it's now \"ok\" to catch & ignore this exception though\nclearly in general you should address its root cause so you don't\naccidentally pollute your term dictionary (see LUCENE-1052, as Grant\nsuggested, once that happens!).\n",

Thanks\nMichael!\n\nThis was happening during DW.abort(), which was being called on an\nunhandled exception to clear all documents added since the last flush.\nIt was incorrectly recycling a null Posting instance.\n\nI've also tightened when abort() is called to only those places that\nactually require it.  A failure in the tokenization of one document\nshould not discard previously indexed documents but not-yet-flushed\ndocuments.  So I added asserts to the test case to verify that.\n",

So even after the TokenStream throws a RuntimeException\nthe DocsWriter is still usable for subsequent docs.\n\n+1 for committing this soon!!",
