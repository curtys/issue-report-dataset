The collector can be executed in the first and second pass if the MultiCollector is used.\n\nbq. We may want to just fold this into the 1st pass collector since it's already looking up group ord + value? \nThe 1st pass collector is more concerned with finding the top N groups. For this it takes in account the sort within a group to choose the right group head. The total group count collector doesn't care about the group sort. It just increments the count if an unseen group has been detected. The group count collector needs to do this for all groups, not just the top N. Therefore I think it is best implemented in a separate collector.\n\nI also measured some basic performance. I used a machine with a 2.16 GHz Core 2 Duo processor and 4GB RAM. I used an index of 30M documents. The group field has around 7500 unique values. The average search time was around 350 ms. The average heap usage was 122 MB. I ran 50 searches in parallel with only the total group count collector.",

In fact, it's sort of odd that the user should even have to pass this in?  Actually, SentinelIntSet rehashes itself... so why do we need to alloc it to the max possible values up front?\n\nAlso, it'd be great to fold this collector in the random test in TestGrouping; I can do that too if you don't want to (TODO <-- I put this here to try to remind my later self!).",

I'm currently think about a TopGroupsEnrich interface that collectors can implement. This allows them to add data to the TopGroups like total group count. The SecondPassGroupingCollector has a list of collectors that implement the TopGroupsEnrich interface. When the getTopGroups() method is executed it iterates of the these collectors and the TopGroups is enriched with data. Downside is that the fields inside TopGroups can't be final and properly we need setters. I think if we do something like this we should do this in a new Jira issue. ",
