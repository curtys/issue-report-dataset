With this patch you can even compare 3.0 against only 3 or 3.0.0.0.0 and they will be equal. And once we are at version 10, a simple string compare is a bad idea :-)\n\nThats why Robert and me are against pure string comparisons.",

This is a comparator to use, when you want to examine the release version that created the segment (the one you added in LUCENE-2720). Its guaranteed to compare correctly if say, we we released 3.10, and also if the number of trailing zeros etc are different.\n\nIn other words, if you implement LUCENE-2921 I think the idea is typically you will want to use this comparator when examining the version string.\n\n{quote}\nRobert, I don't think we are allowed to change index format versions on bug-fix releases and even if we do, that same bug fix would go into the 3.x release so it would still know how to read 3.1.1? Perhaps that was your point and I missed it ...\n{quote}\n\nOn LUCENE-3012, I've proposed a fix-for version for Lucene 3.2. But we can discuss on that issue.\n",
