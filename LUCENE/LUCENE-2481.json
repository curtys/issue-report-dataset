Ie, this is referring to the collection of segments\nthat make up a given commit?  It's confusing to see \"segment\" all over\nbecause it makes me think you're somehow doing something\nper-segment...\n",

In fact, PSDP exists for exactly that purpose, and can also serve as an example for whoever would like to persist the snapshots elsewhere.\n\nbq. Can you rename \"String segment\" -> \"String segmentsFileName\" (or segmentsFile)?\n\nI've renamed it to segmentsFileName, and also segmentToIDs -> segmentsFileToIDs to make it clearer. Thanks for the feedback !\n\nI may commit this tomorrow.",

You have to devise some random key generation scheme? \n\nNo - you can simply use the thread's name :).\n\nBut really, the ID is important for different processes that take a snapshot of the same commit for different purposes. It makes it more clear who holds which snapshot. Also better for debugging later, if say the JVM crashed, and you use the persistency layer, you can tell which of your processes kept a snapshot (and didn't release yet).",

            "body": "Another thing about IDs - they are more user-level API than IndexCommit.\n\nSo Earwin, I agree that we can have snapshot() and release(IndexCommit) to achieve the same functionality (need to be careful w/ multiple snapshots over the same IC). But for users, passing in an IndexCommit is not too friendly. Also, one customer of the API already uses the ID to encode some information that's interesting to him (e.g. name of the process + timestamp) which shows why IDs should remain. It's kind of like the commitUserData given to commits. Another reason is sharing the ID between two different code segments. It's easier to share a String-ID, than to share an IndexCommit. And what exactly is IndexCommit, and how does it translate to a key? Just the segmentsFileName? See - that's a too low level implementation detail IMO ...",
