I believe this defines the semantics we are after for post-grouping faceting.",

            "body": "Right, gender in this example was single-valued per group.\n\nAnother way to visualize / define how post-group faceting should behave is: imagine for ever facet value (ie field + value) you could define an aggregator.  Today, that aggregator is just the count of how many docs had that value from the full result set.  But you could, instead define it to be \"count(distinct(doctor_id))\", and then you'll get the group counts you want.  (Other aggregators are conceivable -- max(relevance), min+max(prices), etc.).\n\nConceptually I think this also defines the post-group faceting functionality, even if we would never implement it this way (ie count(distinct(doctor_id)) would be way too costly to do naively).",

Or if we use this mechanism for faceting documents with the same facet need to be in the same segment??? If that is true, it would make the collectors easier. The SentinelIntSet we use in the collectors is not necessary, because we can lookup the norm from the DocIndexTerms. We won't find the same group in a different segment. On the other hand with scalability in mind would make it complex. Since documents with the in the same group need to be in the same segment. Which makes indexing complex.\n",

Actually the collector has many implementations for different situations. For example when the group sort within the groups is only score or fields. There is a general implementation that works for all sorts (e.g. a function).\n\nJust as in the caching collector there is a factory method that selects the most efficient collector based on the group sort.\n\nTODO:\n* Add tests\n* Clean up code / jdoc\n\nFeedback welcome!",

Ie the\ngrouping collectors aren't normally concerned w/ multivalued fields of\nthe docs within each group.\n\nIt's only because we intend for these new group collectors to make\n\"post-grouping facet counting\" work in Solr that we have a problem.\nIe, these collectors won't properly count facets of fields that have\ndifferent values w/in one group?\n\nSay this is my original content:\n\n{noformat}\n  name=3-wolf shirt\n    size=M, color=red\n    size=S, color=red\n    size=L, color=blue\n\n  name=frog shirt\n    size=M, color=white\n    size=S, color=red\n{noformat}\n\nBut, I'm not using nested docs (LUCENE-2454), so I had to fully\ndenormalize into these docs:\n\n{noformat}\n  name=3-wolf shirt, size=M, color=red\n  name=3-wolf shirt, size=S, color=red\n  name=3-wolf shirt, size=L, color=blue\n  name=frog shirt,   size=M, color=white\n  name=frog shirt,   size=S, color=red\n{noformat}\n\nNow, if user does a search for \"color=red\"... without post-group\nfaceting (ie what Solr has today), you incorrectly see count=3 for\ncolor=red.\n\nWith post-group faceting, you should see count=2 for color=red (which\nthese collectors will do, correctly, I think?), but you should also\nsee count=2 for size=S, which I think these collectors will fail to\ndo?  (Ie, because they only retain the top doc per group...?).\n",

To implement this we need to modify Solr's faceting code / facet module code. So I think we can close this one and open a Solr issue to implement grouped facets in Solr (I do have some code for this, but it isn't perfect...) and maybe also an issue to add this to the faceting module",

    "description": "This issues focuses on implementing post grouping faceting.\n* How to handle multivalued fields. What field value to show with the facet.\n* Where the facet counts should be based on\n** Facet counts can be based on the normal documents. Ungrouped counts. \n** Facet counts can be based on the groups. Grouped counts.\n** Facet counts can be based on the combination of group value and facet value. Matrix counts.   \n\nAnd properly more implementation options.\n\nThe first two methods are implemented in the SOLR-236 patch. For the first option it calculates a DocSet based on the individual documents from the query result. For the second option it calculates a DocSet for all the most relevant documents of a group. Once the DocSet is computed the FacetComponent and StatsComponent use one the DocSet to create facets and statistics.  \n\nThis last one is a bit more complex. I think it is best explained with an example. Lets say we search on travel offers:\n|||hotel||departure_airport||duration||\n|Hotel a|AMS|5\n|Hotel a|DUS|10\n|Hotel b|AMS|5\n|Hotel b|AMS|10\n\nIf we group by hotel and have a facet for airport. Most end users expect (according to my experience off course) the following airport facet:\nAMS: 2\nDUS: 1\n\nThe above result can't be achieved by the first two methods. You either get counts AMS:3 and DUS:1 or 1 for both airports.",
