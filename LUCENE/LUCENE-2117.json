I'm still thinking about moving snowball into analyzers as a analyzers/snowball would that make sense?\n\nSomewhat unrelated but still ugly:\n{code}\n      Class<?> stemClass = Class.forName(\"org.tartarus.snowball.ext.\" + name + \"Stemmer\");\n{code}\nWhen I look through the patch I see this \"name\" parameter which is used to load a stemmer per reflection. We should really define a factory interface that creates the stemmer and get rid of the refelction code",

There i have suggested we upload the snowball stoplists (which are nice) so that we can get rid of some hand-coded java functionality. It is silly to have the exact same Russian stemmer in two different places in contrib, etc.\n\nthen we have open issues like LUCENE-559...",
