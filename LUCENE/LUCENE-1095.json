Maybe a different patch to change the default behavior in StopFilter and in QP for 3.0?",

So it\nshould work ok when stop filters and \"expanders\" are concatenated.\n\nAdded API:\n\n{code}\n   QueryParser {\n       public boolean getApplyPositionIncrements();\n       public void setApplyPositionIncrements(boolean applyPositionIncrements);\n   }  \n{code}\n\nAnd\n\n{code}\n    StopFilter {\n        public boolean getApplyPositionIncrements();\n        public void setApplyPositionIncrements(boolean applyPositionIncrements);\n        public static boolean getDefaultApplyPositionIncrements()\n        public static void setDefaultApplyPositionIncrements(boolean defaultApplyPositionIncrements)\n   }\n{code}\n\nNote the two new static methods in StopFilter - these allow to control behavior system wide, and this way affect the behavior of classes that construct a StopFilter internally, like StopAnalyzer and StandardAnalyzer, without needing to  pollute the API of many classes (all Snowball analyzers for instance) with new API. \n\nParse tests and search tests were added.\nAll tests pass.\n\nFeedback is required:\n* Comments on the proposed API:\n   ** the static methods approach?\n   ** perhaps \"enable\" instead of \"apply\"?\n* Do you think this should be added now (it is ready I think) or would you rather to hold this for after 2.3?",
