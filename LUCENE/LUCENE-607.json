This is a serious bug. \n\nChristian Kohlschuetter diagnosed this as the root problem underlying LUCENE-398 and posted a first patch there.\n\nI've addressed a couple issues in the patch (close skipped field TermEnum's, generate field iterator only once, integrated Christian's test case as a Lucene test) and packaged in all the revised patch here.\n\nAll Lucene tests pass, and I've further tested in this in my app, which makes extensive use of ParallelReader.\n",
