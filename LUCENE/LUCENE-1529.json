Over in LUCENE-1593 we hit a case where (I think) the test should have failed, because we changed a method from returning void to returning something else.\n\nEG if you change IndexWriter.addDocument to (say) return int instead of void, then I think ant test-tag should fail, but it doesn't.",

Is that ok?\n\nAnyway, can it be that the classes/java in the classpath cause this change to not fail?",

            "body": "bq. If I change the definition to rely only on tag.jar, demo classes and junit jar:\n\nOoh that's good progress!\n\nHmm, yes we will now see compilation errors because over time we've made \"legal\" fixes to the test source code, corresponding to changes in 2.9.  Eg, since FieldInfo is package private, we're allowed to rename omitTf to OmitTermFreqAndPositions, and if a test (TestOmitTf) is using package-private access to access omitTf, it's OK to fix that test to match the new name.\n\nSo I think the only way to make \"legal\" changes to the back-compat tests is to backport [a subset of, or perhaps compile-time emulation of] the 2.9 changes onto the 2.4 branch src/java/*.  Or, to fix tests not to rely on package private APIs.  I think that's OK (we make such changes rarely)?  I'll go and fix the back-compat branch accordingly...",
