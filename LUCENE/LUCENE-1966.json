            "body": "Basem, thanks for the patch, and the comments.\n\nOne thing I noticed: if I apply the patch, \u0639\u0644\u0649 (the stopword) will not be filtered as a stopword. This is because it will be normalized to \u0639\u0644\u064a (the name).\n\nSo, if we are going to normalize before stopfilter, I think we need to make sure the stopwords do not contain yeh without dots, or else these will not work. This is one example of why I was scared to apply normalization before stopwords, because by doing so, we cause \u0639\u0644\u0649 and \u0639\u0644\u064a to conflate.\n\nLet me know what you think about this.\n",

Also, using stopwords will affect phrase search, most of the search engines avoid removing them. But, at the end it depends on the client's application, and what she really wants, as enterprise search could have very specific and different needs than Internet search.\n\nAnyways, still I am testing the Arabic Analyzer, and I will provide you with more comments soon. but for the stopwords they are good for now :)",
