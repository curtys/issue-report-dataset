    "description": "When you hit an unhandled exception in ConcurrentMergeScheduler, it\nthrows a MergePolicy.MergeException, but there's no easy way to figure\nout which index caused this (if you have more than one).\n\nI plan to add the Directory to the MergeException.  I also made a few\nother small changes to ConcurrentMergeScheduler:\n\n  * Added handleMergeException method, which is called on exception,\n    so that you can subclass ConcurrentMergeScheduler to do something\n    when an exception occurs.\n\n  * Added getMergeThread() method so you can override how the threads\n    are created (eg, if you want to make them in a different thread\n    group, use a pool, change priorities, etc.).\n\n  * Added doMerge(...) to actually do this merge, so you can do\n    something before starting and after finishing a merge.\n\n  * Changed private -> protected on a few attrs\n\nI plan to commit in a day or two.\n",
