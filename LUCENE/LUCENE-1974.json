It's also concerning that no unit test catches this... \n\nI've said it before, I'll say it again... anything of sufficient complexity really benefits from random tests to hit boundary cases that one would not have thought to code for.  We have quite a few in Solr, but not enough.  We obviously don't have enough in Lucene either.\n\nOne other simple tactic I've used in Solr to increase the chance of hitting boundary conditions is to make sure many segments are created by default (bad for performance, good for testing), and that cache sizes, window sizes, etc are small so that they are crossed more often by more tests.\n\n",
