This patch looks completely broken, but it isn't - and my mind was also broken when I first saw the patch - because of that. This patch is cooler than all heavy commiting during ApacheCon.\n\n+1 for 3.0 with this patch.That was what I wanted to say with my complete nonsense comment.",

I think there was some discussion on the list about allow a getField() or something for multitermqueries, but in the meantime, this patch will work for now, and its internal to the highlighter so its not like it would have to be deprecated later.\n\nWe discussed on ApacheCon about that. My idea was a Fieldable interface that provides getField and the highlighter must only check instanceof Fieldable. And cloning is really the simpliest to create a copy of MTQ, as *all* Query instances are cloneable (because Query implements Cloneable)",

I suppose we could make the argument that this can tide us over - but it will only take a couple of minutes to add getFields as well.\n\nI think Simon may argue that this will work in more cases by default - where external queries would have to implement the getFeilds method. Which is a good point. Still would prefer something cleaner, but perhaps that makes this worth it nonetheless. It would prob make sense to fall back to this if getFields returned an empty set anyway - which almost makes it not even worth it to do getFields as things don't get any cleaner ...\n\nWe def want the multitermquery clone - thats for sure - Uwe recently mentioned that as well and I'd been meaning to get around to it myself.",

We can't force older impls out there to implement what we need - sure we can fix it in core easy enough, but its a real hassle to do this in another way that doesnt require outside multitermquery impls to change - we are going to have to fall back to this anyway with any current plans. So might as well nix those plans for now. I'd prefer our \"futurebetterhighlighter\" prompt any changes that require so much hassle. Its prob best just to stick with this method.\n\nI'd just make it so the rest of the IndexReader methods act as if the thing is empty - letting it throw a null pointer exception and catching it makes those impls unhighlightable when they likely could be.",

Introducing dependencies on other contribs is not feasible just for being supported by the highlighter.\n\nOh its feasible :) We already depend on the only contrib that currently has a multiterm query - regex - and memory index. But it looks like the regex dependency snuck in there while working on the spanregexquery support - I don't think its actually needed anymore - we should remove it. Its only a build dependency, so its not actually a big deal - just annoying if it happened to keep growing.\n\n*edit*\n\nHmm - actually, it looks like we can't avoid those dependencies after all - not if we want to test those queries - looks like the contrib dependency on regex stays anyway.

This prevents classes like RegexQuery in contrib from being supported.
