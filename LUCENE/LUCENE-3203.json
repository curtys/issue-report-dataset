    "description": "Large merges can mess up searches and increase NRT reopen time (see\nhttp://blog.mikemccandless.com/2011/06/lucenes-near-real-time-search-is-fast.html).\n\nA simple rate limiter improves the spikey NRT reopen times during big\nmerges, so I think we should somehow make this possible.  Likely this\nwould reduce impact on searches as well.\n\nTypically apps that do indexing and searching on same box are in no\nrush to see the merges complete so this is a good tradeoff.\n",
