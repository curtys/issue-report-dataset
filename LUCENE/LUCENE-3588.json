            "body": "Here a much simplier patch than the one yesterday (including Robert's test):\nThe added complexity by ConcurrentHashMap with WeakReference and ReferenceQueue is nonsense, as CHM is optimized for many clients getting entries from the map. In our use-case the only one who gets entries from the map is our close() method. When cloning, we only call put() so its always synchronized by CHM and no difference to a standard synchronized WhateverMap.\nThis patch uses the simple apprach: Use a native WeakHashMap where we have a synchronization on the put()/close() cleanups. This removes all Reference handling and simplifies code a lot.\n\nI think this is ready to commit.",

    "description": "We are unmapping mmapped byte buffers which is disallowed by the JDK, because it has the risk of SIGSEGV when you access the mapped byte buffer after unmapping.\n\nWe currently prevent this for the main IndexInput by setting its buffer to null, so we NPE if somebody tries to access the underlying buffer. I recently fixed also the stupid curBuf (LUCENE-3200) by setting to null.\n\nThe big problem are cloned IndexInputs which are generally not closed. Those still contain references to the unmapped ByteBuffer, which lead to SIGSEGV easily. The patch from Mike in LUCENE-3439 prevents most of this in Lucene 3.5, but its still not 100% safe (as it uses non-volatiles).\n\nThis patch will fix the remaining issues by also setting the buffers of clones to null when the original is closed. The trick is to record weak references of all clones created and close them together with the original. This uses a ConcurrentHashMap<WeakReference<MMapIndexInput>,?> as store with the logic borrowed from WeakHashMap to cleanup the GCed references (using ReferenceQueue).\n\nIf we respin 3.5, we should maybe also get this in.",
