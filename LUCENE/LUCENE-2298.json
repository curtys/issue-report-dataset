I will attach this separately. ",

The library in mind is \"morfologik-stemming\", here:\n\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/morfologik/\n\nThe code of this library is BSD-licensed and consists mainly of traversal of FSA automata. The stemmer is dictionary based, so it is nearly (ambiguities) 100% accurate for words in the dictionary and 0% accurate for non-dictionary words (returns null).\n\nThe problem with Morfologik is that its dictionary data is LGPL-ed, so it would have to be a separate download. \n\nThis is just a suggestion for discussion. I guess this functionality is limited to a very narrow audience anyway.\n\n",

Staszek suggested that perhaps it would be convenient if this patch detected if another Polish stemming library for Polish is present in classpath and if so, used it.\n\nHello, perhaps we can provide this as a separate option?\n\nThe problem with doing this is what to do if the classpath detection fails? would it fall back on the code here?\nThis magic could cause a lot of confusion, for example: indexing on a server with correct classpath, searching \non another where it is incorrect, or vice-versa.\n\nIn my opinion, for analysis stuff, if the environment isn't setup correctly, we should just throw an exception.\n",

The problem with Morfologik is that its dictionary data is LGPL-ed, so it would have to be a separate download. \n\nDawid, I looked at Morfologik's source code and it refers to this link: http://www.sjp.pl/slownik/en/\nIs this correct? Because this appears to be licensed under GPL, LGPL, MPL and Creative Commons ShareAlike licenses.\n\nbq. This is just a suggestion for discussion. I guess this functionality is limited to a very narrow audience anyway.\n\nBut if we can, why not provide two options?\nIn this case I think we should just open a separate JIRA issue for Morfologik.\nIts really a different method than what this stemmer does anyway.",
