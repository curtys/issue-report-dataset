            "body": "The reason for this is that the parse() method does not ensure that the entire input string has been consumed. Query() will simply return if it encounters an unexpected token, relying on its caller to consume that token. If the query is nested, the call will throw an exception. But at the top-level, the caller is parse(), and it does not make sure that <EOF> is reached. \n\nA simple fix is to introdice a new nonterminal TopLevelQuery ::= Query <EOF>, and parse() calls TopLevelQuery. I have a patch for this, will post it together with a few new unit test cases for this. \n\nAndreas.",

That caused a failure with the new QueryParser. \n\n- Andreas.\n",

            "body": "I like it. There are some extra tests that demonstrate where parse exceptions are going to be thrown, which is nice.\n\nIt would be nice if we could, perhaps, be more liberal in what we accept. For example, I've always thought it would be nice if we could add in missing terminators, e.g., quotes, parentheses., in the spirit of \"being liberal in what you accept.\" But I don't see that being too feasible with an automatically generated parser.\n\nI do think completely ignoring terms, which this patch fixes, is the wrong way to be liberal.",
