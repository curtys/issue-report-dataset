The same applies to the AttributeImpl, the cloning should not be done in the ctor. The problem is not that the TokenStream or the Attribute instance may reuse the attribute in different threads, the problem is that the factory class (the Analyzer) does reuse the Collator in different threads when it produces multiple tokenstreams or the AF multiple attributes.\n\nThis is a slight difference, because the following code is always safe:\nnew CollationFilter(Collator.newInstance(lang)), cloning would be wrong.\n\nThe reason for the whole thing: TokenStream and Attribute instances itsself are single-threaded only, but not the factory or the analyzer.",

This is because JDK collators are in fact thread safe.\n\n{quote}\nThis is a slight difference, because the following code is always safe:\nnew CollationFilter(Collator.newInstance(lang)), cloning would be wrong.\n{quote}\n\nI don't think this is really a reasonable example, usually in the search engine you would never use code like this: the sort keys will be way too large for no reason. For example usually its the case you will set something more reasonable like primary strength (case-insensitive).\n\nBecause the clone is cheap, and this is a trap to users, I'm still going to fight for my original patch. This way the ICU and JDK functionality behave consistently from a user perspective.",

So its good to clone to reduce contention.\n\nAlso i took a look at harmony, which simply wraps the ICU impl and doesn't sync, which means its not thread safe (but should be).\n\nFor these reasons I think we should just clone the JDK one for safety too.\n",
