My code shows me to be running 2.0.1.\n\nIn the file results.jsp, I replaced the code:\nquery = QueryParser.parse(queryString, \"contents\", analizer);\n\nwith the follwowing:\nQueryParser qp = new QueryParser(\"contents\",analizer);\nquery = qp.parse(queryString);\n\nI also changed the string \"url\" to \"path\" in the following line of code to enable the hperlinks to work:\nfrom:\nString url = doc.get(\"url\");\n\nto:\nString url = doc.get(\"path\");\n\n",

            "body": "Hmmm ... I've been wondering about this. Turns out that both the svn tag lucene_2_0_0 and the 2.0.0 src tar ball have \"2.0.1-dev\" in common-build.xml. I don't know if this was intentional, so that the someone using the signed binary tar ball would be clearly distinguishable from something that someone had built? Wouldint think so, but I'm not too up on ASF release procedures.\n\nIn any case, it's easier to understand that someone will see 2.0.1-dev even if they haven't been working with the lucene_2_0 branch (where I would expect it).\n\nThat said, what do we do with issues like this? Close as a dup/already fixed with a release 2.1 and let them lobby for a release if they find it critical?",
