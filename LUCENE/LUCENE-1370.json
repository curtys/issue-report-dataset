            "body": "It's an OK filter setting if you ask me.\n\nHowever I'm curious to why you don't query for unigrams unless the input is a single token? That means you always require a 0-slop between any two tokens of the input. I know nothing about your needs, but it could be dangerous. You can always boost the bigrams a bit more than the unigrams if they cause a problem. I think you should benchmark the cost. I'm sure it's rather small and that you'll get better quality results by doing that. Users tend to never enter a query the way I want them to.",

When I last tested on the same index, same machine, same # of threads in my testing process, etc., and went from analyzing my queries with\n\noutputUnigrams==true\n\nto analyzing with\n\nusing outputUnigrams==false and outputUnigramIfNoNgrams==true\n\nphrase queries ended up performing something like 50x as fast. Which is good, because the initial performance wasn't acceptable.\n\nThe performance gains from outputUnigramIfNoNgrams were greater than those from when I instead tried moving the index to a solid state drive. (It was a a fairly entry-level SSD drive, but still.) It would be interesting to compare to moving to a machine with an obscene amount of RAM. (Not quite sure what would count as \"obscene\", but my index is 90+GB. Maybe half of that is taken up by stored fields.)",

(I've myself seen\n: performance gains similar to the latter.)\n\nI'm not sure I totally understand you, so let me try rephrasing things. What I mean is that phrase queries that have only bigrams, like this:\n\nPhraseQuery\n{\n\"please divide\"\n\"divide this\"\n\"this sentence\"\n\"sentence into\"\n\"into shingles\"\n}\n\nrun maybe 50x as fast as phrase queries that have both bigrams and unigrams, like this:\n\nPhraseQuery\n{\n\"please\", \"please divide\"\n\"divide\", \"divide this\"\n\"this\", \"this sentence\"\n\"sentence\", \"sentence into\"\n\"into\", \"into shingles\"\n\"shingles\"\n}\n\nIf it clarifies things any further, let me say that I'm handling all quoted phrase queries with the normal PhraseQuery class; I'm not, for instance, turning quoted phrases into some kind of BooleanQuery. (Technically it's not me that's making the PhraseQuery object but Solr and its query parser. But Solr is indeed turning my quoted phrase queries into normal PhraseQuery objects.)",

            "body": "Any ideas on whether it will ever make sense for this patch to make it into the trunk? Some random thoughts:\n\n * The latest patch does make ShingleFilter marginally less clean. (Maybe my least favorite part is how fillShingleBuffer() is now responsible for setting firstToken; that it should do so is not obvious from the method name.)\n * This patch's functionality could potentially be implemented without modifying ShingleFilter itself. For example, maybe instead of patching ShingleFilter we could have a ShingleFilterUnigramWrapper class, that would delegate to ShingleFilter, except when ShingleFilter failed to produce ngrams. I'm a little worried that this would require using a CachingTokenFilter, and that might not be ideal from an efficiency perspective.\n * It might be good to rename outputUnigramIfNoNgrams to something like forceUnigramIfNoNgrams. With the current naming scheme, you end up setting some contradictory-sounding options, e.g. setting outputUnigrams==false and outputUnigramIfNoNgrams==true. If you look at the code this might not be confusing, but it'd be nice if it were more straightforward without making you look at the code.\n * I gather that some people have an interest in making a minShingleSize option. (See http://www.nabble.com/shingle-filter-td25125367.html) I'm not sure how best to modify this patch should that get implemented. It might depend on the typical use cases for minShingleSize, and if there's any overlap with my use case here.\n",

    "description": "Currently if ShingleFilter.outputUnigrams==false and the underlying token stream is only one token long, then ShingleFilter.next() won't return any tokens. This patch provides a new option, outputUnigramIfNoNgrams; if this option is set and the underlying stream is only one token long, then ShingleFilter will return that token, regardless of the setting of outputUnigrams.\n\nMy use case here is speeding up phrase queries. The technique is as follows:\n\nFirst, doing index-time analysis using ShingleFilter (using outputUnigrams==true), thereby expanding things as follows:\n\n\"please divide this sentence into shingles\" ->\n \"please\", \"please divide\"\n \"divide\", \"divide this\"\n \"this\", \"this sentence\"\n \"sentence\", \"sentence into\"\n \"into\", \"into shingles\"\n \"shingles\"\n\nSecond, do query-time analysis using ShingleFilter (using outputUnigrams==false and outputUnigramIfNoNgrams==true). If the user enters a phrase query, it will get tokenized in the following manner:\n\n\"please divide this sentence into shingles\" ->\n \"please divide\"\n \"divide this\"\n \"this sentence\"\n \"sentence into\"\n \"into shingles\"\n\nBy doing phrase queries with bigrams like this, I can gain a very considerable speedup. Without the outputUnigramIfNoNgrams option, then a single word query would tokenize like this:\n\n\"please\" ->\n   [no tokens]\n\nBut thanks to outputUnigramIfNoNgrams, single words will now tokenize like this:\n\n\"please\" ->\n  \"please\"\n\n****\n\nThe patch also adds a little to the pre-outputUnigramIfNoNgrams option tests.\n\n****\n\nI'm not sure if the patch in this state is useful to anyone else, but I thought I should throw it up here and try to find out.\n",
