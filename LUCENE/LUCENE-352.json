When I attempt to exclude \nmore than one term I get an error. \n \nThe example query I'm using is:  \n \n'brighton AND tourism' -pier -contents \n \nI construct the query objects and the toString() version is: \n \nspanNot(spanNear([contents:brighton contents:tourism], 10, false), \nspanOr([contents:pier, contents:road])) \n  \n \nSteps to reproduce: \n1. Construct a SpanNearQuery (must have at least one term, but at least two \nmakes more sense) \n2. Construct a SpanOrQuery containing two or more terms \n3. Construct a SpanNotQuery to include the first query object and exclude the \nsecond (SpanOrQuery) \n4. Execute the search \n \n \nActual Results: \nA null pointer exception is thrown while generating the scores within the \nsearch. \n \nStack trace:  \njava.lang.NullPointerException   \n        at   \norg.apache.lucene.search.spans.SpanOrQuery$1.doc(SpanOrQuery.java:174)   \n        at   \norg.apache.lucene.search.spans.SpanNotQuery$1.next(SpanNotQuery.java:75)   \n        at org.apache.lucene.search.spans.SpanScorer.next(SpanScorer.java:50)   \n        at org.apache.lucene.search.Scorer.score(Scorer.java:37)   \n        at   \norg.apache.lucene.search.IndexSearcher.search(IndexSearcher.java:92)   \n        at org.apache.lucene.search.Hits.getMoreDocs(Hits.java:64)   \n        at org.apache.lucene.search.Hits.<init>(Hits.java:43)   \n        at org.apache.lucene.search.Searcher.search(Searcher.java:33)   \n        at org.apache.lucene.search.Searcher.search(Searcher.java:27)   \n        at   \ncom.runtimecollective.search.LuceneSearch.search(LuceneSearch.java:362)   \n \n \nExpected Resuts: \nIt executes the search and results where the first search terms (near query) \nare close together but without the second terms (or query) appearing.",
