As a result, in close, where we wait until all running and\npending merges complete, we will never return.\n\nThe fix is simple: invoke the merge scheduler inside\ncopyExternalSegments() if any segments were copied.  I also added\ndefensive invocation of the merge scheduler during close, just in case\nother code paths could allow for a merge to be added to the pending\nqueue but not scheduled.\n\n",
