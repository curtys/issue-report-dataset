            "body": "I fixed the PREFIX definition in QueryParser.jj, changed:\n         (<_TERM_START_CHAR> | \"*\") (<_TERM_CHAR>)* \"*\" >\nto \n         (\"*\") | ( <_TERM_START_CHAR> (<_TERM_CHAR>)* \"*\" ) >\nwhich I think is more correct, and this solved the problem. \n\nHowever this caused another parsing test (testSimple) to fail - aparently from other reasons: the standard analyzer used in that test is lower casing the query tokens, which have umlauts - and this fails, because the lower casing is done char by char (Character.lowercase). I think that the wrong definition of PREFIXTERM was masking this behavior before. I am not sure yet if this is a bug, but for testSimple to pass for now I would modify the test to use a non lowercasing analyzer when umlauts are present. Please comment if you think this is a bug.\n\nAnother tehnical issue that came up is line endings - compiling on XP, using cygwin, the javacc result files had wrong line endings.\nFixed that with \n   perl -p -e 's/(\\r\\n|\\n|\\r)/\\n/g'  QueryParser.java_fromJavacc > QueryParser,java\nDo others have this problem?\nIs there is a standard solution for this (other than installing *Nix?)\nIf not I may look into allowing to fix this by build.xml.\n\nWill have a patch with the fix later today.",

I'm compiling on Win XP too, using eclipse and the javacc plugin. That used to work fine for me, but now it doesn't anymore, the result files have inconsistent line endings. ",
