However, I think it's unlikely apps are using this rather expert API, and we already don't have jar drop-in ability for 2.9 anyway, and as you said if you attempt to pass a non-BooleanQuery, you'll hit a cast exception anwyay.\n\nI plan to commit shortly.",

We should enforce this by changing the signature. This won't really break back compat. as it only works with instances of BooleanQuery.\n\n",
