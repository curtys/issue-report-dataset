Appears to be a clear and simple bug, but the test issue is not so clear and simple and looks like it could drag out the fix being applied here - but that doesn't seem necessary?",

That would prevent uncommenting the test - I guess @Ignore would work too but maybe we want disable / enable at a central place for tests like that.\n\n\nsimon",
