            "body": "I think the add() methods as implemented in this patch are of limited usefulness... The reason I created a pair of similar classes in SOLR-1632 was to avoid creating new objects by allowing modification of int/long members in place, which is useful when aggregating partial stats. So I think a more useful implementation of add() could look like this:\n\n{code}\npublic void add(CollectionStatistics other) {\n  assert this.field.equals(other.field);\n  this.maxDoc += other.maxDoc;\n  this.docCount += other.docCount;\n  this.sumTotalTermFreq += other.sumTotalTermFreq;\n  this.sumDocFreq += other.sumDocFreq;\n}\n{code}\n\nRegarding the handling of -1: this code doesn't handle the case when only one stats is -1, which may happen in distributed scenario. I think in such case a -1 value should be treated as 0, i.e. it should not \"reset\" the accumulated value from other shards to -1, right?",
