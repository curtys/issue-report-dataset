Once loaded, a\n * synonym lookup via {@link #getSynonyms(String)}takes constant time O(1).\n * A loaded default synonym map consumes about 10 MB main memory.\n * An instance is immutable, hence thread-safe.\n * <p>\n * This implementation borrows some ideas from the\n * Lucene Syns2Index demo that Dave Spencer\n * dave&#064;searchmorph.com originally contributed to Lucene. Dave's approach\n * involved a persistent Lucene index which is suitable for occasional\n * lookups or very large synonym tables, but considered unsuitable for \n * high-frequency lookups of medium size synonym tables.\n * <p>\n * Example Usage:\n * <pre>\n * String[] words = new String[] { \"hard\", \"woods\", \"forest\", \"wolfish\",\n\"xxxx\"};\n * SynonymMap map = SynonymMap(new FileInputStream(\"samples/data/wn_s.pl\"));\n * for (int i = 0; i &lt; words.length; i++) {\n *     String[] synonyms = map.getSynonyms(words[i]);\n *     System.out.println(words[i] + \":\" +\njava.util.Arrays.asList(synonyms).toString());\n * }\n * \n * Example output:\n * hard:[arduous, backbreaking, difficult, fermented, firmly, grueling,\ngruelling, heavily, heavy, intemperately, knockout, laborious, punishing,\nsevere, severely, strong, toilsome, tough]\n * woods:[forest, wood]\n * forest:[afforest, timber, timberland, wood, woodland, woods]\n * wolfish:[edacious, esurient, rapacious, ravening, ravenous, voracious,\nwolflike]\n * xxxx:[]\n * </pre>\n * \n * @author whoschek.AT.lbl.DOT.gov\n * @see <a target=\"_blank\"\n *     \nhref=\"http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/man/prologdb.5WN.html\">prologdb\n *\tman page </a>\n * @see <a target=\"_blank\"\nhref=\"http://www.hostmon.com/rfc/advanced.jsp\">Dave's synonym demo site</a>\n */\n",
