I think to make this committable I'd have to\nswitch to processing the positions in chunks (like BooleanScorer).\n",

This buys another 15% speedup (12.30 QPS, net 2.9X faster than trunk) on United States phrase query.\n\nAlso, I fixed MultiPhraseQuery to sort its clauses by approx docFreq; the optimization is approx in this case because we can't efficiently compute the docFreq of a position that's unioning > 1 term.",

I think I somehow screwed up my performance tests above.\n\nI'm testing search perf (working on LUCENE-2504), and in comparing search perf from 2.9.x -> 3.x, I only saw a ~20% speedup on the phrase query \"united states\", for a 5M doc Wikipedia index.  And, re-running the test on trunk pre and post this commit, I still see only ~20% gain.... still not sure what I did wrong.\n\nI'll update CHANGES.  Two steps forward, one step back... sigh.",

    "description": "Looking the scorers for PhraseQuery, I think there are some speedups\nwe could do:\n\n  * The AND part of the scorer (which advances to the next doc that\n    has all the terms), in PhraseScorer.doNext, should do the same\n    optimizing as BooleanQuery's ConjunctionScorer, ie sort terms from\n    rarest to most frequent.  I don't think it should use a linked\n    list/firstToLast() that it does today.\n\n  * We do way too much work now when .score() is not called, because\n    we go and find all occurrences of the phrase in the doc, whereas\n    we should stop only after finding the first and then go and count\n    the rest if .score() is called.\n\n  * For the exact case, I think we can use two int arrays to find the\n    matches.  The first array holds the count of how many times a term\n    in the phrase \"matched\" a phrase starting at that position.  When\n    that count == the number of terms in the phrase, it's a match.\n    The 2nd is a \"gen\" array (holds docID when that count was last\n    touched), to avoid clearing.  Ie when incrementing the count, if\n    the docID != gen, we reset count to 0.  I think this'd be faster\n    than the PQ we now use.  Downside of this is if you have immense\n    docs (position gets very large) we'd need 2 immense arrays.\n\nIt'd be great to do LUCENE-1252 along with this, ie factor\nPhraseScorer into two AND'd sub-scorers (LUCENE-1252 is open for\nthis).  The first one should be ConjunctionScorer, and the 2nd one\nchecks the positions (ie, either the exact or sloppy scorers).  This\nwould mean if the PhraseQuery is AND'd w/ other clauses (or, a filter\nis applied) we would save CPU by not checking the positions for a doc\nunless all other AND'd clauses accepted the doc.\n",
