Deprecated methods should still work though - so whether return null from getTerm is right or wrong, I dunno.\n\nBut thats the issue - except for TermRangeQuery, the Highlighter looks for the Field by calling getTerm and asking for the field - made the exception for TermRangeQuery, but not NumericRangeQuery - so it throw a nullpointer exception. Easy to sidestep in Lucene, more of a pain in Solr (as the plan is to release with 2.9.0)",

What is the pattern term for TermRangeQuery or NumericRangeQuery. Both return null and that is fine (and not a backwards break, as both classes are new in 2.9). That was exactly the discussion behind removing the getTerm() stuff from MTQ.\n\nSolr could maybe remove the NRQ from the highligter query.",

Don't remember though).\n\nHowever, unless it was documented to return null, just deprecating it doesn't really fix things. Code thats trying to use it on the base MultiTermQuery isn't going\nto be checking if its null unless its documented as such.\n\nI agree its screwed and it will be nice when its gone.\n\nLike I said, its a moot point.

I should have caught that and done a better doc job on MulitTermQuery. I'm not claiming back compat issues, I'm claiming its wrong.\n\nOn a side note, its a bummer we seem to have lost the history on RangeQuery.",
