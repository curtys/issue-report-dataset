            "body": "After thinking one day about it, I found some problems with the \"collector hack\" and this style of decorator pattern:\n- If you wrap multiple times, the setScorer() method in the wrapped collector may set the wrong scorer (you see this, if you wrap multiple ConstantScoreQueries on top of each other, then the boost of the inner one is returned. The problem is that the score(Collector) method inverts the decorator pattern.\n- The inner scorer (like BoolenScorer with its buckets) may set a different scorer in the collector than itsself that implements doc() different, so setting the ConstantScorer always as collector's scorer can lead to wrong results (we dont see this in the test, as no collector uses Scorer.doc(), only Scorer.score(), which returns constant).\n\nI changed the code so CSQ now passes always topScorer=false to Weight.scorer() of the wrapped query and does not overwrite score(Collector,...) methods. It still allows out-of-order collection. Now BooleanScorer2 is always used with MTQs.\n\nThe question is, would the previous but broken optimization make sense for speed? Mike/Mark?",

            "body": "Attached is the correct solution of ConstantScoreQuery with a scorer that supports topScorer and directly delegates hit collection to its wrapped scorer. This enables use of the bucket-using BooleanScorer instead of BooleanScorer2 for MTQs.\n\nThe test case verifies that the correct boosts are collected and queries wrapped two times with different boosts return the correct scores, too.",

    "description": "Especially in MultiTermQuery rewrite modes we often simply need to strip off scores from Queries and make them constant score. Currently the code to do this looks quite ugly: new ConstantScoreQuery(new QueryWrapperFilter(query))\n\nAs the name says, QueryWrapperFilter should make any other Query constant score, so why does it not take a Query as ctor param? This question was aldso asked quite often by my customers and is simply correct, if you think about it.\n\nLooking closer into the code, it is clear that this would also speed up MTQs:\n- One additional wrapping and method calls can be removed\n- Maybe we can even deprecate QueryWrapperFilter in 3.1 now (it's now only used in tests and the use-case for this class is not really available) and LUCENE-2831 does not need the stupid hack to make Simon's assertions pass\n- CSQ now supports out-of-order scoring and topLevel scoring, so a CSQ on top-level now directly feeds the Collector. For that a small trick is used: The score(Collector) calls are directly delegated and the scores are stripped by wrapping the setScorer() method in Collector\n\nDuring that I found a visibility bug in Scorer (LUCENE-2839): The method \"boolean score(Collector collector, int max, int firstDocID)\" should be public not protected, as its not solely intended to be overridden by subclasses and is called from other classes, too! This leads to no compiler bugs as the other classes that calls it is mainly BooleanScorer(2) and thats in same package, but visibility is wrong. I will open an issue for that and fix it at least in trunk where we have no backwards-requirement.",
