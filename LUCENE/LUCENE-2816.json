So I adapted For/PFOR\nto just take DataInput and work on it directly, instead of reading into a byte[], wrapping it with a ByteBuffer,\nand working on an IntBuffer view.\n\nBut when I did this, i found that MMap was slow for readInt(), etc. So we implement these primitives\nwith ByteBuffer.readInt(). This isn't very important since lucene doesn't much use these, and mostly theoretical \nbut I still think things like readInt(), readShort(), readLong() should be fast... for example just earlier today \nsomeone posted an alternative PFOR implementation on LUCENE-1410 that uses DataInput.readInt().\n\nMMapIndexInput readInt() improvements [bulkpostings, FrameOfRefDataInput codec]\n||Query||QPS branch||QPS patch||Pct diff||||\n|spanFirst(unit, 5)|12.14|11.99|{color:red}-1.2%{color}|\n|united~1.0|11.32|11.33|{color:green}0.1%{color}|\n|united~2.0|2.51|2.56|{color:green}2.1%{color}|\n|unit~1.0|6.98|7.19|{color:green}3.0%{color}|\n|unit~2.0|6.88|7.11|{color:green}3.3%{color}|\n|spanNear([unit, state], 10, true)|2.81|2.96|{color:green}5.2%{color}|\n|unit state|8.04|8.59|{color:green}6.8%{color}|\n|+unit +state|10.97|12.12|{color:green}10.5%{color}|\n|unit*|26.67|29.80|{color:green}11.7%{color}|\n|\"unit state\"|5.59|6.27|{color:green}12.3%{color}|\n|uni*|15.10|17.51|{color:green}15.9%{color}|\n|state|33.20|38.72|{color:green}16.6%{color}|\n|+nebraska +state|59.17|71.45|{color:green}20.8%{color}|\n|un*d|35.98|47.14|{color:green}31.0%{color}|\n|u*d|9.48|12.46|{color:green}31.4%{color}|\n\nHere's the same benchmark of DataInput.readInt() but with the MultiMMapIndexInput\n\nMultiMMapIndexInput readInt() improvements [bulkpostings, FrameOfRefDataInput codec]\n||Query||QPS branch||QPS patch||Pct diff||||\n|united~2.0|2.43|2.54|{color:green}4.3%{color}|\n|united~1.0|10.78|11.39|{color:green}5.7%{color}|\n|unit~1.0|6.81|7.21|{color:green}5.8%{color}|\n|unit~2.0|6.62|7.05|{color:green}6.5%{color}|\n|spanNear([unit, state], 10, true)|2.77|2.96|{color:green}6.6%{color}|\n|unit state|7.85|8.53|{color:green}8.7%{color}|\n|spanFirst(unit, 5)|10.50|11.71|{color:green}11.5%{color}|\n|+unit +state|10.26|11.94|{color:green}16.3%{color}|\n|\"unit state\"|5.39|6.31|{color:green}17.0%{color}|\n|state|31.95|39.17|{color:green}22.6%{color}|\n|unit*|24.39|31.02|{color:green}27.2%{color}|\n|+nebraska +state|54.68|71.98|{color:green}31.6%{color}|\n|u*d|9.53|12.62|{color:green}32.5%{color}|\n|uni*|13.72|18.23|{color:green}32.9%{color}|\n|un*d|35.87|48.19|{color:green}34.3%{color}|\n\nJust to be sure, I ran this last one on sparc64 (bigendian) also.\n\nMultiMMapIndexInput readInt() improvements [bulkpostings, FrameOfRefDataInput codec]\n||Query||QPS branch||QPS patch||Pct diff||||\n|united~2.0|2.23|2.26|{color:green}1.5%{color}|\n|unit~2.0|6.37|6.47|{color:green}1.6%{color}|\n|united~1.0|11.33|11.59|{color:green}2.3%{color}|\n|unit~1.0|9.68|10.05|{color:green}3.7%{color}|\n|spanNear([unit, state], 10, true)|15.60|17.54|{color:green}12.5%{color}|\n|unit*|127.14|144.08|{color:green}13.3%{color}|\n|unit state|44.93|51.30|{color:green}14.2%{color}|\n|spanFirst(unit, 5)|58.42|68.37|{color:green}17.0%{color}|\n|uni*|56.66|67.53|{color:green}19.2%{color}|\n|+nebraska +state|215.62|262.99|{color:green}22.0%{color}|\n|+unit +state|63.18|77.86|{color:green}23.2%{color}|\n|\"unit state\"|32.24|40.05|{color:green}24.2%{color}|\n|u*d|29.13|36.69|{color:green}26.0%{color}|\n|state|145.99|188.33|{color:green}29.0%{color}|\n|un*d|65.27|87.20|{color:green}33.6%{color}|\n\nI think some of these benchmarks also show that MultiMMapIndexInput might now be\nessentially just as fast as MMapIndexInput... but lets not go there yet and keep them separate for now.\n",
