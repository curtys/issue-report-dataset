            "body": "Luis,\nI will post an example of queries and the constructed Query objects when I am back from holidays (Thursday+). In principle the syntax would be the same like for normal range queries, only that the min/max arguments may be double, float, int, long or dates. You would create instances of NumericRangeQuery from it using one of the static factories for each data type (for dates a conversion to long using Date.getTime() would be done). The datatype must be somehow predefined for the field names using some type of schema (per field).. Open ends use \"*\" and the [], (), {} would define if incl. NumericRangeQuery is a subclass of MultiTermQuery so the rewrite method also applies to this query. For NRQ there is also a config parameter precisionStep which default value is 4, but should be also configureable per-field together with the data type.\n\nExample code for creating the NRQ are in the JavaDocs and there are 2 JUnits in trunk (TestNumericRangeQuery*) showing how it is used. Also the new LIA2 contains a chapter about it.",

            "body": "To go back to the idea why I opened the issue (and I think, this is also Mike's intention):\n\nFrom what you see on java-user, where users asking questions about how to use Lucene:\nMost users are not aware of the fact, that they can create Query classes themselves. Most examplecode on the list is just: \"I have such query string and I pass it to lucene and it does not work as exspected.\" It is hard to explain them, that they should simply not use a query parser for their queries and just instantiate the query classes directly. For such users it is even harder to customize this query parser.\n\nMy intention behind is: Make the RangeQueryNodeBuilder somehow configureable like Luis proposed, that you can set the type of a field (what we do not have in Lucene currently). If the type is undefined or explicite set to \"string/term\", create a TermRangeQuery. If it is set to any numeric type, create a NumericRangeQuery.newXxxRange(field,....).\n\nThe same can currently be done by the original Lucene query parser, but only for dates (and it is really a hack using this DateField class). I simply want to extend it that you can say: \"this field is of type 'int' and create automatically the correct range query for it.\" Because the old query parser is now \"deprecated\", I want to do it for the new one. This would also be an intention for new users to throw away the old parser and use the new one, because it can be configured easily to create numeric ranges in addition to term ranges.",

How is it going to be handled buy users expecting RangeQuery objects?\n\nThe \"new\" QP builder, delegates a query node based on its class to a builder, if there is no builder that knows how to build an object from that class it keeps looking up in the class hierarchy until it finds a builder that knows how to. Query nodes are supposed to be conceptual objects, they just represent some concept X, and ideally anything that fits in this concept should inherit from it, this way the user can create their own specific query nodes with no need to change how they are built (if there is no need for that). What I'm trying to say here is that if I create a node Y which extends X, I don't need to specify a new YBuilder for it, the XBuilder will be used. So, ideally, NumericRangeQueryNode should extends RangeQueryNode, the problem here is that we also need to specify a builder for the NumericRangeNode, and if the user sets a builder for RangeNode it will never be invoked for NumericRangeNode objects. Maybe it shouldn't at all, because if a new builder was specified for NumericRangeNode, it means a new kind of object should be built from it, something the user probably don't know yet, since it's a new kind of node, and his custom code needs to be updated anyway to support it.\n\nHowerver, there is a solution for this kind of back-compat problem (which I don't think it is). In a future release, if a new XRangeQueryNode is created, instead of set\n\n{code}\n luceneBuilderMap.setBuilder(RangeQueryNode.class, new RangeQueryNodeBuilder());\nluceneBuilderMap.setBuilder(XRangeQueryNode.class, new XRangeQueryNodeBuilder());\n{code}\n\nWe could do:\n\n{code}\nrangeBuilderMap.setBuilder(RangeQueryNode.class, new RangeQueryNodeBuilder());\nrangeBuilderMap.setBuilder(XRangeQueryNode.class, new XRangeQueryNodeBuilder());\n\n// then\n\nluceneBuilderMap.setBuilder(RangeQueryNode.class, rangeBuilderMap);\n{code}\n\nThis way, if the user reset the RangeQueryNode builder to its own builder, it will still be called for XRangeQueryNode and RangeQueryNode objects.\n\nLet me know if there is any question about what I just described.

By that you can define simply the type of a range query: term, numeric-int, numeric-float, numeric-double, date-precision-xxx,... Based on this enumeration, the upper/lower terms are parsed differently and different query objects are created. We just need to list all possible combinations of data types, the user could create: We could make this class extensible, if it is a Lucene Parameter class also supporting the parsing and building: One could simply create a new constant for his specific range type and supply methods to parse and build the query in the constant's implementation (so each constant contains also code to parse/build). I am not sure how to do this with the new parser.

We have here the same problem: You change the inner class implementations, but the abstract QueryParser's API is stable. The general contract when doing such things is, that you use instanceof checks before you try to cast some abstract return type to something specific, not documented.\n\nYou have the same in various factories also in the very bw-oriented JDK: XML factories create things like SAXParser and so on. If you cast the returned objects to some special implementation class, its your problem, because you remove the abstraction and work with implementations. This happened e.g. from the change between Java 1.4 to 1.5, when the internal SAX parsers were exchanged and their class names changed. A lot of programs broke by that, because the developers casted the objects returned from factories without instanceof checks.",

This processor should also convert the range string values to numeric values based on the NumericType\n\n-create a NumericRangeQueryNodeBuilder, which will build which will build NumericRangeQuery objects from NumericRangeQueryNode objects\n\n-rename RangeQueryNode to TermRangeQueryNode as it will only be used for string\n\n-create a NumericRangeQueryNode which will be used for any non-string range query\n\n-merge DateTools with a new NumericTools class.

Does numeric fields also support this kind of query? I could only fine NumericRangeQuery, but no NumericQuery. If the user enters (age:19) in the query, and \"age\" is a numeric field, should the query parser throw an error saying it's not suppported?\n\nI am planning to create a GSOC proposal for this project, it looks interesting, very cool this new support to numeric in Lucene, I missed that first time I used Lucene, maybe because I was used to regular databases.

Sorry for taking so long to submit a new patch, but I was hitting many problems when I finally started run the junits.\n\nI updated my workspace and got the new changes which use NumericField to add numeric fields to Documents. So I adapted my junits to that and also refactored some code to use NumericField.DataType in NumericConfig, instead of using Class<? extends Number> when specifying the NumericConfig type.\n\nI added a junit class (TestNumericQueryParser). I reused some LuceneTestCase methods, mainly the ones that generate random things. I took sometime to get where I wanted, I was hitting many problems when using dates in range. In the end, I liked the way the junit is running, inputs are very random, mainly the date formats, using randomly different format styles and locale. I ran the junit in a loop 1000 times and I got no error, so I think it's pretty stable now. Uwe, please, take a look and let me know what you think about it.\n\ntestInclusiveLowerRangeQuery and testInclusiveUpperRangeQuery are commented since I found that StandardQueryParser is not supporting mixed include syntaxes, such as {1 TO 2].

But he did change the query node inheritance, which may affect how processors and builder (specially QueryNodeTreeBuilder) work. I am not saying it is not possible to implement his approach on 3.x, but he will need to deal differently with query nodes classes he created. As I said before, what he did is good and clean, I like the way it is, but it will break someone's code if pushed to 3.x. So if you ask me whether to push it to 3.x, I say YES, just make sure to not break the query node structure that people may be relying on.\n\n{quote}\nAs we are now at mid-time, it would be a good idea, to maybe add some extra syntax support for numerics, like \"<\" and \">\"?

As QueryParser seems to lowercase the range bounds, some dates cannot be parsed.\n\nThis throwed with your patch a NPE, because you implemented NumberDateFormat wrong: public Number parse(String source, ParsePosition parsePosition) is allowed to return null (it must if a parse error occurs). The same applies to date formats, but if you call getTime() on a null Date it throws NPE.

Then I later realized someone had submitted a patch for that already and I stopped working on it.\n\nThen I decided to implement support for date resolutions for numeric queries in query parser. I started by changing NumberDateFormat to receive a resolution parameter (DAY, SECONDS, MINUTES, etc) and this new parameter is taken into account when doing the date conversion. For that, I added a new method to do the date rounding that takes TimeZone into account, since the current round methods in DateTools do not support timezone. I was able to make it work up to this part.\n\nAfter that, I started to work on date compression, as you suggested before Uwe. For example, if the user wants a DAY resolution, NumberDateFormat should only return the number of days for the given date since 1970, not the miliseconds. For SECOND resolution, it's easy, just divide the miliseconds by 1000. For minutes the same, divide the miliseconds by 1000 * 60 and so on. However, when I got to month, I have no easy way to compress the miliseconds, I mean, no easy way to truncate the days and only get the month count since 1970. The only good solution I found was to get the number of years since 1970 and multiply by 12 plus the current month number.\n\nI am still wondering if we can always assume that dividing the miliseconds by 1000 (sec), 60 (minute), 60 (hour) and 24 (day) will actually be precise.

It does not help for API changes (it could sometimes, but only for those cases where the API changes are something like: If versionA call method a else method b, if method a or b trigger different APIs).\n\nTypical examples for Version are changes in tokenization (so most analyzers use it): When a bugfix in the analyzer produces different tokens than before the version flag is used to be able to enable the \"buggy\" behaviour, so querying your index with the \"wrong\" tokens still works. The core queryparser also uses it to change the behaviour of creating phrase queries (the flexible query parser is, as far as I know, still missing this).\n\nI am away this weekend, I will come back to you on Monday for the other questions.",

If the user has created it's own query builder (or somehow extended/modified the current builder), changes to what the processor pipeline outputs might break user's code.\n\n- syntax parser changes: if the syntax parser starts outputting a different query node tree it may break any user processor or builder\n\n- whenever a builder is expecting XQueryNode and then in a later version is expects YQueryNode as input\n\nThe question is: should we support versioning for the above changes or should we only document the changes and let the user be aware of such change?\n\nI think we should be very careful and only use Version when it's really required (like things that imply in index changes).

The problem here is that deprecation inherits... To fix, you have to declare all methods and let them call super without deprecation.\n\nI agree with the rest of Adriano's comments.\n\nIn general this is a contrib module and contrib modules don't have the strict backwards requirements like core classes. Because of this I would only provide minimal backwards layers (no sophisticated ones) and document all changes. Backwards compatibility sometimes get a pain, so we even document and break backwards in core (sometimes). We list all those breaks in the backwards section. Backwards breaks that can be fixed by recompilation are very minor and should only be documented (as drop-in-JAR replacements no longer work), so they are no issue at all.\n\nbq.

I don't think 4.0 will have the same requirement, will it?\n\n4.0 breaks backwards completely with no deprecation layers. The core API of Lucene changed hard (new enum types, new structures, totally new API, change from char[] to byte[],... the list is very long). We have a MIGRATION.txt that explains all changes.\n\nWe only add deprecation layers in 3.x core for cases where very high-level user classes are affected (e.g. IndexSearcher.search() methods, so transition is easy). All other places in Lucene that are more expert will change as described before.",

However, ParametricRangeQueryNode and AbstractRangeQueryNode do not share the same methods (as Adriano said above). ParametricRangeQueryNode has lower and upper bound, which are ParametricQueryNodes, and these last ones hold the inclusive/exclusive information (they use CompareOperator for that). AbtractRangeQueryNode have lower and upper bounds (these ones defined by the template, so it could be a ParametricQueryNode, which is compatible with ParametricRangeQueryNode), however it holds the inclusive/exclusive information differently, through isLowerInclusive and isUpperInclusive methods.\n\nI just don't understand why ParametricQueryNode hold this CompareOperator value, I think this should be part of the ParametricRangeQueryNode and ParametricQueryNode should only be a simple value (FieldQueryNode). Any suggestions here?",

Today, if you want, you can set a ParametricRangeQueryNode with CompareOperator.LE set in the two bounds :S. Lets take the opportunity and try to redesign it.\n\nI also agree that ParametricRangeQueryNode could only have FieldQueryNode as its bounds, so I think we can get rid of ParametricQueryNode (for 4.0). For now, I will suggest the following change:\n\n- keep using ParametricQueryNode in ParametricRangeQueryNode\n\n- deprecate ParametricQueryNode\n\n- make ParametricRangeQueryNode implement that RangeQueryNode interface I mentioned on my last comment. This interface will have isLowerInclusive, isUpperInclusive, setUpperInclusive and setLowerInclusive. For the template parameter, ParametricRangeQueryNode should use FieldQueryNode.\n\n- Make sure whenever the user sets lowerInclusive and upperInclusive we replicate that to the ParametricQueryNode (upper and lower bounds) setting the equivalent CompareOperator.\n\nI think this way we can get rid of ParametricQueryNode in future.

The logic is reversed compared to the fix in 4.0 thus making it unusable.\n\nThat is the logic in 3.x:\n{code}\nsuper(lower, upper, lower.getOperator() == CompareOperator.LE, upper\n        .getOperator() == CompareOperator.GE);\n{code}\n\nand the logic in 4.x:\n{code}\nreturn new TermRangeQueryNode(lower, upper,\n          lower.getOperator() == CompareOperator.GE,\n          upper.getOperator() == CompareOperator.LE);\n{code}",

    "description": "It would be good to specify some type of \"schema\" for the query parser in future, to automatically create NumericRangeQuery for different numeric types? It would then be possible to index a numeric value (double,float,long,int) using NumericField and then the query parser knows, which type of field this is and so it correctly creates a NumericRangeQuery for strings like \"[1.567..*]\" or \"(1.787..19.5]\".\n\nThere is currently no way to extract if a field is numeric from the index, so the user will have to configure the FieldConfig objects in the ConfigHandler. But if this is done, it will not be that difficult to implement the rest.\n\nThe only difference between the current handling of RangeQuery is then the instantiation of the correct Query type and conversion of the entered numeric values (simple Number.valueOf(...) cast of the user entered numbers). Evenerything else is identical, NumericRangeQuery also supports the MTQ rewrite modes (as it is a MTQ).\n\nAnother thing is a change in Date semantics. There are some strange flags in the current parser that tells it how to handle dates.",
