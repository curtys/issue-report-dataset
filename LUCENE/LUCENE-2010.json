If you delete all documents from the whole index, no segments would keep alive if automatically removed.\n\nIW now has a dedicated method to [efficiently] delete all docs, but yeah we should also short-circuit this, in case someone didn't use that method and instead actually deleted every doc separately.\n\nI'd think that our solution here would automatically handle this case (drop all segments) as well.\n\nOn materializing deletes (IndexWriter.applyDeletes) we should simply sweep the segmentInfos, and drop any fully deleted segments.  Should be a simple change.",
