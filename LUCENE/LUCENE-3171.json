Or, where is this possible inefficiency (is it something specific)?\n\nbq. I would prefer to use single pass and for now I only need the parent docs. That means that I have no preference for 2454 or this one.\n\nI wonder how often apps \"typically\" need just the parent docs vs the groups (w/ child docs)...\n\nBut, still this patch only calls .nextSetBit() once per group so that ought to be faster than LUCENE-2454, I think... hmm, unless you typically only have 1 child match per parent.",

The whole thing could be stored in one int[], the pointers would be (forward) indexes into this one array, and each internal node would consist of two rows of integers (one data, one pointers), and each row would be compressed as a frame of reference into the array.\n\nThis thing can implement {code}int next(int x){code} and {code}int previous(int x){code} easily, and an iterator over this can implement {code}advance(target){code} for a DocIdSetIterator, and because of the symmetry it can also do that in the reverse direction as needed here.\nCompression at higher levels might not be necessary.\n\nFor now, there is no code for this, except for the frame of reference.\nOccasionaly the need for a more space efficient filter shows up on the mailing lists, so if anyone wants to give this a try...\n\n",

Though, I suspect this (the linear scan OBS does for next/prevSetBit) is a minor cost overall, if indeed the app has so many child docs per parent that a sparse bit set would be warranted?  Ie, the Query/Collector would still be visiting these many child docs per parent, I guess?  (Unless the query hits few results).\n\nI don't think a jdoc warning is really required for this... but I'm fine if you want to add one?\n\nI'll commit this soon and resolve LUCENE-2454 as duplicate!",

    "description": "I created a single-pass Query + Collector to implement nested docs.\nThe approach is similar to LUCENE-2454, in that the app must index\ndocuments in \"join order\", as a block (IW.add/updateDocuments), with\nthe parent doc at the end of the block, except that this impl is one\npass.\n\nOnce you join at indexing time, you can take any query that matches\nchild docs and join it up to the parent docID space, using\nBlockJoinQuery.  You then use BlockJoinCollector, which sorts parent\ndocs by provided Sort, to gather results, grouped by parent; this\ncollector finds any BlockJoinQuerys (using Scorer.visitScorers) and\nretains the child docs corresponding to each collected parent doc.\n\nAfter searching is done, you retrieve the TopGroups from a provided\nBlockJoinQuery.\n\nLike LUCENE-2454, this is less general than the arbitrary joins in\nSolr (SOLR-2272) or parent/child from ElasticSearch\n(https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/553), since you\nmust do the join at indexing time as a doc block, but it should be\nable to handle nested joins as well as joins to multiple tables,\nthough I don't yet have test cases for these.\n\nI put this in a new Join module (modules/join); I think as we\nrefactor join impls we should put them here.\n",
