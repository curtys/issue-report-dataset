Ie, fixing this would almost always improve\napplications?\n\nI think most Lucene users are not aware that this truncation is\noccurring (it's not something you'd expect).\n\nOr, are we thinking that there are quite a few applications where\ntruly enormous documents are indexed and this change is going to cause\nmassive slowdown for such applications?\n",

It was clearly doing something wrong (incorrectly marking acronyms), yet we had to do the deprecation dance to handle it b/c there may be applications that rely on that functionality.  This one seems a little  less problematic, I agree.  There may, however, be applications out there that occasionally hit a really large document and don't want it to throw off their indexing, so they truncate it.\n\nI think we ought to have a separate discussion on our back compatibility standards on java-dev, as I, personally, think we have some room for improvement when it comes to these kinds of things.   I will kick it off, as it has been something I have been mulling for a while.",

I named the inner class MaxFieldLength instead of FieldLength.\n\nThe patch deprecates the pre-existing constructors, and adds a new constructor with the added parameter for each of the pre-existing constructors.  As a result, the patch could be applied to the trunk as soon as 2.3 has been released; the deprecated pre-existing constructors would then be removed as part of the 3.0 release.\n\nThe patch also replaces all IndexWriter constructor calls in the tree with their equivalents taking the explicit max field length parameter.  (I excluded IndexModifier, because it is already scheduled for removal as part of the 3.0 release.)\n\nI see that in o.a.l.demo.IndexHTML.java, the max field length is set significantly above the current default limit:\n\n71:   writer = new IndexWriter(index, new StandardAnalyzer(), create);\n72:   writer.setMaxFieldLength(1000000);\n\nShould the above two lines be replaced with the following? (I did *not* do this in the attached patch):\n\n   writer = new IndexWriter(index, new StandardAnalyzer(), create, \n       IndexWriter.MaxFieldLength.UNLIMITED);\n\nThat is, should the demo use Integer.MAX_VALUE instead of 1,000,000 for the maximum field length?",

Or is it that I pass in a LIMITED or UNLIMITED and then immediately go call indexWriter.setMaxFieldLength()?
