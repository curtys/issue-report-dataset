(The blue arcs just indicate arcs that were compressed with a NEXT flag when stored in the byte[].)\n\nTo get the total output you sum the outputs you encounter.  For example, the input \"stop\" hits output 4 on the 's' and output 1 on the o so its ord is 5.",

But, there is a non-sorted-order version too, however, they will be substantially more RAM consuming since they'd use a objects for node/arcs (this impl doesn't).",

It remains to be seen if the CPU cost of traversing the FST is offset by the fact that the FST can keep more (possibly, all) terms in memory.\n\nAlso we'd need to figure out whether this'd work at the top-level reader (eg as an initial filter to enumerate all terms matching the MTQ), or, per-segment as the terms index (which'd be much more RAM costly).\n\nbq. E.g. could we add posting lists for inner nodes to the index?\n\nHmm... what are the \"inner nodes\"?\n\nI guess we could do something like Pulsing codec, where postings for low doc-freq terms are simply stored in an FST, and then only the higher freq terms remain on disk (optionally of course since whether this is feasible depends on the app).  Then eg lookups against a primary key field would be entirely in RAM.",

So I have no idea how the generics *should* look like. I don't even understand all the SuppressWarnings currently in the code, because in my opinion, generics warnings cannot occur at all those places. From a first look it seems that a few places using untyped Output, but for that the methods need to be generified (a generic <T> before the return type like in AttributeSource). The \"copy\" in one of the TODOs cannot be avoided by generics, because the generics are type erasure, so it would not help in that method (only that you may not need to add so many casts, which on the other hand the compiler will add).",

There are several problems:\n\n- FST<T> as parameter to Outputs.write() and Outputs.read() breaks generics in PairOutput (I added nocommit, this is really why we have the generics, without that this bug would never be visible). Mike said, that there should be really used IndexInput and IndexOutput\n- The testcase is broken, as it dynamically casts types depending on int constants. The test should be rewritten to use typed inner classes (and some code duplication)\n\nI may have missed more generics violations, but it now compiles correctly. Javac does not detect all missing parameters, so I have to review again, but for now I want to post the patch.",

Here's the link for reference: http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6525802\n\nAs far as I see is the slow part a.getClass().getComponentType().

    "description": "\nI implemented the algo described at\nhttp://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.24.3698 for\nincrementally building a finite state transducer (FST) from sorted\ninputs.\n\nThis is not a fully general FST impl -- it's only able to build up an\nFST incrementally from input/output pairs that are pre-sorted.\n\nCurrently the inputs are BytesRefs, and the outputs are pluggable --\nNoOutputs gets you a simple FSA, PositiveIntOutputs maps to a long,\nByteSequenceOutput maps to a BytesRef.\n\nThe implementation has a low memory overhead, so that it can handle a\nfairly large set of terms.  For example, it can build the FSA for the\n9.8M terms from a 10M document wikipedia index in ~8 seconds (on\nbeast), using ~256 MB peak RAM, resulting in an FSA that's ~60 MB.\n\nIt packs the FST as-it-builds into a compact byte[], and then exposes\nthe API to read nodes/arcs directly from the byte[].  The FST can be\nquickly saved/loaded to/from a Directory since it's just a big byte[].\n\nThe format is similar to what Morfologik uses\n(http://sourceforge.net/projects/morfologik/).\n\nI think there are a number of possible places we can use this in\nLucene.  For example, I think many apps could hold the entire terms\ndict in RAM, either at the multi-reader level or maybe per-segment\n(mapping to file offset or to something else custom to the app), which\nmay possibly be a good speedup for certain MTQs (though, because the\nformat is packed into a byte[], there is a decode cost when visiting\narcs).\n\nThe builder can also prune as it goes, so you get a prefix trie pruned\naccording to how many terms run through the nodes, which makes it\nfaster and even less memory consuming.  This may be useful as a\nreplacement for our current binary search terms index since it can\nachieve higher term density for the same RAM consumption of our\ncurrent index.\n\nAs an initial usage to make sure this is exercised, I cutover the\nSimpleText codec, which currently fully loads all terms into a\nTreeMap (and has caused intermittent OOME in some tests), to use an FST\ninstead.  SimpleText uses a PairOutputs which is able to \"pair up\" any\ntwo other outputs, since it needs to map each input term to an int\ndocFreq and long filePosition.\n\nAll tests pass w/ SimpleText forced codec, and I think this is\ncommittable except I'd love to get some help w/ the generics\n(confession to the policeman: I had to add\n@SuppressWarnings({\"unchecked\"})) all over!!  Ideally an FST is\nparameterized by its output type (Integer, BytesRef, etc.).\n\nI even added a new @nightly test that makes a largeish set of random\nterms and tests the resulting FST on different outputs :)\n\nI think it would also be easy to make a variant that uses char[]\ninstead of byte[] as its inputs, so we could eg use this during analysis\n(Robert's idea).  It's already be easy to have a CharSequence\noutput type since the outputs are pluggable.\n\nDawid Weiss (author of HPPC -- http://labs.carrotsearch.com/hppc.html -- and\nMorfologik -- http://sourceforge.net/projects/morfologik/)\nwas very helpful iterating with me on this (thank you!).\n",
