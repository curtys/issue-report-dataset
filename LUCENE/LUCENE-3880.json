Short of handling all aspects of the {{mailto:}} scheme (out of scope for this issue), I think it would be useful to employ a trick similar to the charFilter hack described by Kai G\u00fclzau: explicitly split \"mailto:\" off from a following email address, allowing the email address to be recognized as such.\n",
