    "description": "Mike found a few cases in flex where we have some bad behavior with automatonquery.\nThe problem is similar to a database query planner, where sometimes simply doing a full table scan is faster than using an index.\n\nWe can optimize automatonquery a little bit, and get better performance for fuzzy,wildcard,regex queries.\n\nHere is a list of ideas:\n* create commonSuffixRef for infinite automata, not just really-bad linear scan cases\n* do a null check rather than populating an empty commonSuffixRef\n* localize the 'linear' case to not seek, but instead scan, when ping-ponging against loops in the state machine\n* add a mechanism to enable/disable the terms dict cache, e.g. we can disable it for infinite cases, and maybe fuzzy N>1 also.\n* change the use of BitSet to OpenBitSet or long[] gen for path-tracking\n* optimize the backtracking code where it says /* String is good to go as-is */, this need not be a full run(), I think...\n",
