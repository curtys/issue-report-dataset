    "description": "It would be nice to add an expert API to specify an indexing chain, so that\nwe can make use of Mike's nice LUCENE-1301 feature.\n\nThis patch simply adds a package-protected expert API to IndexWriter and \nDocumentsWriter. It adds a inner, abstract class to DocumentsWriter called \nIndexingChain, and a default implementation that is the currently used one.\n\nThis might not be the final solution, but a nice way to play with different\nmodules in the indexing chain.\n\nCould you take a look at the patch, Mike?
