I wonder if we should also do a weak ref type of dealie that auto closes the reader for users who aren't calling IR.close?  \n\nTo answer the question, yes, close on IR must be called.  I can't directly do anything about the javadocs so I'll leave that for Mike.",

EG you can close the writer and continue using the reader.  And you must close the reader.\n\nI'll backport that fix to 3.0 & 2.9.",

    "description": "I am not sure if this is a \"bug\" or really just me not reading the Javadocs right...\n\nThe IR returned by IW.getReader() leaks file handles if you do not close() it, leading to starvation of the available file handles/process. If it was clear from the docs that this was a *new* reader and not some reference owned by the writer then this would probably be ok. But as I read the docs the reader is internally managed by the IW, which at first shot lead me to believe that I shouldn't close it.\n\nSo perhaps the docs should be amended to clearly state that this is a caller-owns reader that *must* be closed? Attaching a simple app that illustrates the problem.",
