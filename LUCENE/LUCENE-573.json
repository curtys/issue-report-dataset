            "body": "Tomislav,\n\nthanks for finding this problem in the queryparser. I attach a patch file that fixes this bug. Now the queryparser does not recognize an escaped quote inside a phrase as the phrase terminator anymore. \n\nI also updated the testcase org.apache.lucene.queryParser.TestQueryParser to test escaped quotes within phrases. This testcase fails with the old version of the queryparser and runs successful with the patched version. I added the following three tests to the testEscaped() method:\n\n(1)    assertQueryEquals(\"a \\\\\\\"b c\\\\\\\" d\", a, \"a \\\"b c\\\" d\");\n(2)    assertQueryEquals(\"\\\"a \\\\+b c d\\\"\", a, \"\\\"a \\\\+b c d\\\"\");\n(3)    assertQueryEquals(\"\\\"a \\\\\\\"b c\\\\\\\" d\\\"\", a, \"\\\"a \\\\\\\"b c\\\\\\\" d\\\"\"); \n\t\nPlease notice that (3) is different from your second suggested assert. You assume that the queryparser unescapes the quotes inside the phrase, but the queryparser does not unescape *any* escaped characters inside a phrase. You can see that in (2), where the escaped + (plus) character does not become unescaped.\n\nMichael",

Query parser may not unescape things like the \\+ in this example....\n     foo \"bar \\+baz\"\n...but i believe that is because there is no reason for it to do so, if what you intended was to match on the + character without a preceding s\\ you could have just written...\n     foo \"bar +baz\"\n...ie: the plus is already escaped by the nature of being inside the  phrase bounding quotes\n\nthis same justification does not hold for the double-quote character however ... there is no way to inlcude a \" character inside of a phrase without escaping, so it seems like query parser should be unescaping it automatically for you.\n\ncorrect?\n",

So does anyone currently search for backslash in a phrase query???",

However, it is still not possible to search for a phrase query that contains quotes.\n\nI think the simple solution is to call discardEscapeChar(String) for the phrase string. Then *all* escaped characters within a phrase become unescaped.\n\nNow the question is again (Yonik raised it already): Do we want this behavior or do we rather want to maintain backward compatibility for already existing phrase queries that include a backslash? If we prefer compatibility over consistency then one solution would be to add a new method discardEscapeChar(String, char[]) that only unescapes certain characters, in this case \" and \\.\n\nIf we can make a decision here I'm happy to provide a new patch.",
