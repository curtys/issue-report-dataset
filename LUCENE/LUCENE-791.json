Also added a UseCases section where it would be cool if people donated how they solved a particular problem in Lucene.\n\nMoved some of the old planning pages to the Archives section.\n\nStill would like to know how to set it up to send edit notifications to the commit list.  Is this an Infrastructure issue or is it something that can be handled by either the PMC or the committers?",
