    "description": "Here's a patch that adds a remove() method to the Document class (+test case). This \nis very useful if you have converter classes that return a Lucene Document object but \nyou need to make changes to that object. \n \nIn my case, I wanted to index PDF files that were saved as BLOBs in a database. The \nfiles need to be saved to a temporary file and that file name is given to the PDF \nconverter class. The PDF converter then saves the name of the temporary file name \nas the file name, which doesn't make sense. So my code needs to remove the \n'filename' field and re-add it, this time with the columns primary ID. This is only possible \nwith the attached patch.",
