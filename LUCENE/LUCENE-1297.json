I implemented JaroWinkler since I'm suggesting proper names and it does a good job with those.\n\nWith the StringDistance interface defined, anyone can implement the distance measure however they want.  What I think would be very useful is weighted version of edit distance with the weights tuned to your target language/domain.  Also with support in solr for specifying this parameter in the SpellCheckRequestHandler, changing this just becomes a config change.\n\n\n",

You created a new class (LevenshteinDistance), but your patch shows it as an edit of TRStringDistance.  It should show it as a brand new file.  Could you please provide a clean patch?  This is why the patch fails to apply.\n\nThanks.\n",

I'll change the name back though I think given that there are now going to be more than one of these a more descriptive name makes sense.\n\nAdded ASL to Jaro class.",

As for the Wiki, I think it is on the Solr wiki, but should be added to the Lucene one, too.",

A getter would make sense too, so that one can see what the threshold is.\n\nAlso, the TRStringDistance explicitly states that it is not thread safe.  I believe it is now being used in a non thread-safe manner.  FWIW, I see no reason why it can't be made thread-safe.  All of those member variables are being allocated in the getDistance method, so no reason not to just make them local variables, I think.",

It just converts the int from the Levenshtein into a value between 0 and 1.      1 being identical, 0 being maximally different.  This return value is part of the StringDistance interface and different methods compute this value differently so it's necessary to compute it on a per distance measure basis.   \n\nThanks...Tom",
