            "body": "This is great Mike !\n\nI reviewed SearcherManager and have a comment about the TODO on whether or not to call warm in the ctor. If an extending class relies on some internal members to be initialized before warm() can safely be called, then this will lead to exceptions. I think that warm() should not be called in the ctor, or at least add a ctor which accepts a boolean doWarm, while the other ctors call it with 'true'.\n\nCalling warm() in the ctor is useful if one wants to warm the IndexSearcher instance before SearcherManager is ready for use. So perhaps an additional ctor with the boolean gives the most flexibility.\n\nAlso, I remember there was a ctor which took IndexWriter, to allow for an NRT-SearcherManager. What happened to it? :)",

Mike, would it be possible to merge the NRT and SearcherManager into one class / manager or that maybe both implement the same interface?\n\nRight, they used to be merged.... we could consider merging them again?\n\nNRTManager is more feature-full, though, because it offers add/updateDocument(s) APIs that invoke the writer but return a [long] gen, which you can then turnaround and pass to .get() to ensure the returned searcher includes those changes.  SearcherManager doesn't have notion... unless we somehow tie in the IndexReader.getVersion() somehow?  I'm torn... they seem different enough that maybe they should remain separate.  Plus, users usually know quite strongly if they use NRT or not and could pick the right manager accordingly...",

If you don't want to extend SearcherManager, how would you ensure it's warmed-up after creation?\n\nWell, warm() is a no-op if you don't extend SearcherManager, so, if you extend, you'd impl warm, and then in your ctor you should call warm on the initial searcher if need be.  Definitely trappy so we should jdoc that subclass's ctor must handle warming initial searcher....",

Since this is a noop by default and it requires subclassing to do something with it it might be worth introducing a SearchWarmer interface and simply pass this interface into the ctor ie. have two ctors where by default we pass a noop warmer?",
