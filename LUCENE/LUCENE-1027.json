    "description": "In the o.a.l.benchmark.byTask.utils.Config.java file, the nextRound and various other methods do not handle doubles in the \"round\" property configuration syntax.\n\nTo replicate this, copy the micro-standard.alg and replace \nmerge.factor=mrg:10:100:10:100\nmax.buffered=buf:10:10:100:100\n\nwith\n\nram.flush.mb=ram:32:40:48:56\n\nand you will get various ClassCastExceptions in Config (one in newRound() and, when that is fixed, in getColsValuesForValsByRound.\n\nThe fix seems to be to just to mirror the handling of int[].\n\nThe fix seems relatively minor.  Patch shortly and will plan to commit tomorrow evening.",
