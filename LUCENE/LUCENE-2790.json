The test fails w/o the fix and passes w/ it.\n\nAlso, I noticed that if I don't set noCFSRatio to 1.0, then the added segments are not converted to a CFS. That is because useCompoundFiles on LMP decides not to do that, because the size of the segment, which is 377 bytes, is more than 10% of the total index size, which is ... 0. I wonder if we should handle that case, or leave it as is - at some point, when more documents are added, that segment will be converted to a CFS.\n\nI think that means that the first few segments that will be flushed will remain in non CFS format. I'm fine w/ it, just making sure I understand this right.",

Because the runtime behavior has changed, the tests fail. If you try to call LMP.setNoCFSRation, you get a NoSuchMethodError because the tests are compiled against 3.0's source, where indeed it does not exist.\n\nI'm trying to resolve it by fetching the method using reflection, but this shows another problem w/ how we maintain the backwards tests.",
