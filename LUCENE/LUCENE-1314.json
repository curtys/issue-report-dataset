            "body": "At first glance, my opinion was that adding this flag to reopen() is confusing. reopen()'s current behavior is explained well in the documentation, and has a particular use case in mind (checking if the index has changed, and if it has, reopen it). Frankly, I didn't understand why reopen() should (even with the addition of a new parameter) clone or \"copy on write\" the IndexReader when the index hasn't changed.\nIf this capability is needed, wouldn't it have been clearer if IndexReader had some new clone() or copyOnWrite() (in IndexReader's case, a write would actually be a delete...) method that can be called to get a new object that behaves independently from the previous one when it comes to writing (again, a delete)?\nIn your code, you could then do something like\n\nnewIndexReader = indexReader.reopen();\nif(newIndexReader==indexReader)\n  newIndexReader = indexReader.clone(); // copy on write\nelse {\n   oldIndexReader.close(); // most applications won't do this here, but never mind now.\n}\nindexReader = newIndexReader;\n\nI thought that this was a cleaner API, because reopen() isn't complicated with an extra flag that has nothing to do with its intended function, and the new clone() or copyOnWrite() method can also be used in other situations when you want different objects of the same index to handle deletes separately.\n\nBut on second glance, it dawned on me: You can't actually delete on both objects at once, because when you start deleting in one object, it holds a lock and then you can't do deletions in the second object! So I have to admit, the usefulness of of a general clone/copyOnWrite feature for IndexReader is quite limited. My suggestion above can still be the API, but I admit it will hardly be useful in any situation except (the rare situation nowadays of?) a reopen() and later deletes.",

Using the clone terminology would work as well, inside of SegmentReader the clone would most likely reuse SegmentReader.reopenSegment.  The subclass turns off locking by overriding acquireWriteLock and having it do nothing.  I do not know a general fix for the locking issue mentioned \"it holds a lock and then you can't do deletions in the second object\".  Perhaps there is a way using lock less commits.  It is possible to have SegmentReader implement if deletes occur to an earlier IndexReader and a flush is tried it fails, rather than fail in a newer IndexReader like it would now.  This would require keeping track of later IndexReaders which is something Ocean does outside of IndexReader.  \n\nAs far as the FieldsReader, given how many SegmentReaders Ocean creates (up to one per update), a shallow clone threadlocal would still potentially create many file descriptors.  I would rather see a synchronized FieldsReader, or simply use the approach in the code below.

This would require keeping track of later IndexReaders which is something Ocean does outside of IndexReader.\n\nI think this is tricky, since SegmentReader doesn't explicitly track whether there is a \"cloned\" reader out there.  As things stand now, there is no such thing as a cloned reader, and so the only way that another SegmentReader is out there is if there have been commits to the index, in which case isCurrent() returns false and the old reader will not allow deletes to be performed.  I suppose we could look at the refCount of the IndexReader: any reader that has been cloned and not yet closed will have a refCount > 1, whereas the last reader returned from a clone() call will have refCount 1.\n\nSo unless we try to track this, when there are N clones out there, any one of them will be allowed to grab the write lock when a change (deletion or setNorm) is attempted, thus preventing all the other clones (and all readers open on previous commits) from making changes.",

Ie, if this reader does not currently have the\n    write lock (it has no \"local mods\") it should not acquire it?  One\n    should be allowed to clone a stale reader?\n\n  * Have you done any tests to see the cost of the copy-on-write\n    cloning of deleted docs BitVector & norms?  The first new mod to\n    the cloned reader pays that penalty.  Marvin's \"tombstone\"\n    deletions would bring this penalty to near zero, but it's a big\n    change (and should certainly be decoupled from this!).\n\n  * In IndexReader.clone()'s javadocs can you state that on cloning a\n    reader with pending modifications, the original reader then\n    becomes readOnly (in addition to passing the write lock to the\n    cloned reader)?\n\n  * Can you rename IndexReader.cloneBitVector --> cloneDeletedDocs?\n\n  * When you clone the deleted docs (because refCount is > 1) you are\n    first decRef'ing the old one and then making the clone... can you\n    change that so the decRef is done last?  I don't think any actual\n    bug would result from the way it is now, but let's be defensive\n    (don't decRef something until you really are done using it).\n\n  * Class Ref does not need to delcare its private int refCount as\n    volatile; you always access that member from a synchronized\n    context.\n\n  * In SegmentReader.clone, you incRef the deleteDocsCopyOnWriteRef,\n    but it might be null, right?  Oh I see, it's always init'd to a\n    new Ref() but then you make a new Ref() again on the first\n    delete.  Can you make it null by default?  (Seems like it should\n    be null if deletedDocs is).\n\n  * Can you change Ref() so that it init's its refCount to 1?  This\n    way new Ref() need not immediately call incRef, and a Ref() with\n    refCount 0 is never allowed out into the wild, and you should then\n    add an \"assert refCount > 0\" in incRef as well.\n\n  * In SegmentReader.doClose() you are failing to call\n    deletedDocsCopyOnWriteRef.decRef(), so you have a refCount leak.\n    Can you create a unit test that 1) opens reader 1, 2) does deletes\n    on reader 1, 3) clones reader 1 --> reader 2, 4) closes reader 1,\n    5) deletes more docs with reader 1, and 6) asserts that the\n    deletedDocs BitVector did not get cloned?  First verify the test\n    fails, then fix the bug...\n\n  * How should unDeleteAll() work?  EG it seems like you must decRef\n    the Ref, then set it to null?  Can you add some tests for the\n    various permutations of this?\n\n  * SegmentReader.Norm now has two refCounts, and I think both are\n    necessary. One tracks refs to the Norm instance itself and the\n    other tracks refs to the byte[].

            "body": "LUCENE-1314.patch\n\nMichael, thanks for reviewing the patch in such detail.  All of your comments have been included in the latest version of the patch.\n\nM.M: In SegmentReader.java we have \"if (doClone) acquireWriteLock();\", which isn't right? Ie, if this reader does not currently have the write lock (it has no \"local mods\") it should not acquire it? One should be allowed to clone a stale reader?\n\nCloning a stale reader is fixed in the patch.  The problem is the user may get into trouble by updating the stale reader which was debated before.  I got the impression insuring the reader being updated was the latest was important.  \n\nM.M.: Have you done any tests to see the cost of the copy-on-write cloning of deleted docs BitVector & norms? The first new mod to the cloned reader pays that penalty. Marvin's \"tombstone\" deletions would bring this penalty to near zero, but it's a big change (and should certainly be decoupled from this!).\n\nThe cost of cloning them meaning the creating a new byte array or some other cost like memory consumption?  I need to reread Marvin's tombstones which at first glance seemed to be an iterative approach to saving deletions that seems like a transaction log.  Correct?\n\nM.M.: SegmentReader.Norm now has two refCounts, and I think both are necessary. One tracks refs to the Norm instance itself and the other tracks refs to the byte[]. Can you add some comments explaining the difference (because it's confusing at first blush)?\n\nByte[] referencing is used because a new norm object needs to be created for each clone, and the byte array is all that is needed for sharing between cloned readers.  The current norm referencing is for sharing between readers whereas the byte[] referencing is for copy on write which is independent of reader references.\n\nM.M.: In SegmentReader.doClose() you are failing to call deletedDocsCopyOnWriteRef.decRef(), so you have a refCount leak.  Can you create a unit test that 1) opens reader 1, 2) does deletes on reader 1, 3) clones reader 1 --> reader 2, 4) closes reader 1, 5) deletes more docs with reader 1, and 6) asserts that the\ndeletedDocs BitVector did not get cloned? First verify the test fails, then fix the bug...\n\nIn regards to #5, the test cannot delete from reader 1 once it's closed.  A method called TestIndexReaderClone.testSegmentReaderCloseReferencing was added to test this closing use case.\n",

Test case\nlooks good!  Thanks.\n\nA few more comments:\n\n  * Can you update javadocs of IndexReader.reopen to remove the\n    warning about not doing modification operations?  With\n    copy-on-write you are now free to do deletes against the reopened\n    reader with no impact to the reader you had reopened/cloned.\n\n  * What is SegmentReader.doDecRef for?  It seems dead?\n\n  * SegmentReader.doUndeleteAll has 4 space indent (should be 2)\n\n  * We have this in SegmentReader.reopenSegment:\n{code}\nif (deletedDocsRef == null) deletedDocsRef = new Ref();\nelse deletedDocsRef.incRef();\n{code}\n   But I think if I clone a reader with no deletes, the clone then\n   [incorrectly] has a deletedDocsRef set?  Can you fix that code to\n   keep the invariant that if deleteDocs is null, so is\n   deletedDocsRef, and v/v?  Can you sprinkle asserts to make sure\n   that invariant always holds?\n\n  * In SegmentReader.decRef we have \"if (deletedDocsRef != null &&\n    deletedDocsRef.refCount() > 1) deletedDocsRef.decRef();\" -- but,\n    you should not have to check if deletedDocsRef.refCount() > 1?\n    Does something break when you remove that?  (In which case I think\n    we have a refCount bug lurking...)\n\n  * The norm cloning logic in SegmentReader.reopenSegment needs to be\n    cleaned up... eg we first sweep through each Norm, incRef'ing it,\n    and then make 2nd pass to do full clone.  Really we should have if\n    (doClone) up front and do a single pass?  Also: I think we need\n    that same logic to re-open the singleNormStream for the clone case\n    as well.\n.\n    Hmm, in the non-single-norm stream case I think we also must\n    re-open the norm file, rather than clone it, in Norm.clone().  I\n    think if you 1) open reader 1(do no searching w/ it), 2) clone it\n    --> reader 2, 3) close reader 1, 4) try to do a search against a\n    field that then needs to load norms, you'll hit an\n    AlreadyClosedException, because you had a cloned IndexInput vs a\n    newly reopened one?  Can you add that test case?\n\n  * Why was this needed:\n{code}\nif (doClone && normsDirty) {\n  normsUpToDate = false;\n}\n{code}\n    It seems like leaving normsUpToDate as true should have worked\n    (all the Norm instances are cloned anyway?).\n\n  * In SegmentReader.doUndeleteAll, can you conditionalize on whether\n    deletedDocs != null?  In general rather than having separate\n    checks for deleteDocs != null and deletedDocsRef != null, I'd\n    prefer to check only deletedDocs != null and add an assert that\n    deleteDocsRef != null, with else clause having assert\n    deletedDocsRef == null.\n",

SegmentTermDocs would then AND together the term's postings with the deleted docs postings.  I mocked up a rough test of iteration vs random-access and tentatively found that iteration was a bit faster if %tg deletes was less than 10% or so, but then more costly if it was higher.

This is due to the propagation of the method calls to SegmentReader.doClose previously passed through decRef which could be called by IndexReader.decRef or IndexReader.close.  In order to decref the copy on write refs, the close method needs to decrement the references, rather than simply the decRef method.

Changes:\n\n  * Simplified semantics: if you clone non-readOnly reader1 to\n    non-readOnly reader2, I now simply clear hasChanges & writeLock on\n    reader1 and transfer them to reader2, but do not set readOnly in\n    reader1.  This means reader1 is free to attempt to acquire the\n    write lock if it wants, and it simply fails if it's stale (ie, we\n    just re-use the existing code path to catch this, rather than add\n    a new check), and this way we never have a case where an existing\n    reader \"becomes\" readOnly -- it can only be born readOnly.\n\n  * Added reopen(readOnly) (what Jason referred to above).  I think\n    the semantics are well defined: it returns a new reader if either\n    the index has changed or readOnly is different.\n\n  * Added test for \"clone readOnly to non-readOnly\" case, which\n    failed, and fixed various places where we were not respecting\n    \"openReadOnly\" correctly.\n\n  * Share common source (ReadOnlySegmentReader.noWrite) for throwing\n    exception on attempting change to a readOnly reader\n\n  * Fixed a sneaky pre-existing bug with reopen (added test case): if\n    you have a non-readOnly reader on a single segment index, then add\n    a segment, then reopen it and try to do a delete w/ new reader, it\n    fails.  This is because we were incorrectly sharing the original\n    SegmentReader instance which still had its own SegmentInfos, so it\n    attempts to double-acquire write lock during a single deleteDocument\n    call.\n\n  * More tests\n",

I plan to commit in a day or two.\n\nOK I changed deletedDocRefs to only be inc/decRef'd once for the\nreader, not every time the reader is inc/decRef'd (which was causing\nthe bug you saw).\n\nBut then because of how a reopened SegmentReader references the\noriginal, the deleted docs were being unecessarily copy-on-write'd (on\nclosing the first reader we would fail to decref the deletedDocsRef so\nwhen the 2nd reader did a delete, it would copy).\n\nSo then I added a new coreRef to SegmentReader, instead of the\nreferencedSegmengReader.  I like this approach better because it\nallows the original reader to be closed, without closing the core\nobjects when other readers share them.\n\nIt also simplifies SegmentReader's inc/decRef so that they no longer\nneed to be overridden.\n\nAlso, when cloning the BitVector, I changed it to not copy count over\n-- if a separate thread is changing the deleted docs at the same time,\nthe count could be off.\n\nBack-compat tests don't pass, because TestIndexReaderReopen is\nchecking internal reference counts; I'll commit fixes to tests when I\ncommit.\n",
