It's as before, only \"bugs\" (missing open checks) fixed and code violations (synthetic accessors, final fields).\n\nThe next step will be to remove the add() methods, as IndexReaders should not be changed after create.\n\nWill work more tomorrow.\n\nThe plan is:\n- Move all subreaders to ctor (builder-like API. First build reader-set, then call build)\n- Rename ParallelReader to ParallelAtomicReader\n- Add a ParallelCompositeReader with same builder API, but taking any CompositeReader-set and checks them that they are aligned (docStarts identical). The subreaders are ParallelAtomicReaders.",

If you look at the test cases, the code is much less verbose and better readable.\n\nWell, you separated each method call onto a separate line, so, it'd\nlook basically the same without chaining?  If only all chained API\nconsumers followed your approach...\n\nTo be clear: what I dislike about chaining is it creates ambiguity\nin how you write the code that consumes our APIs.\nYou().can().do().this().  Or, you().\ncan().\ndo().\nthis().  Or maybe you().can().\ndo().this().\n\nAmbiguity is very bad, especially in open-source dev: it invites\nbikeshed wars, harming communities by dividing them, spending precious\ntime debating what from the outside would seem like trivial\ndifferences.\n\nbq. If somebody wants to change this, he can do this in another issue called \"remove all builders from Lucene\"\n\nThe first API I would fix is IndexWriterConfig; its setters should not\nbe chainable, because now we get code like this:\n\n{noformat}\nIndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(dir, newIndexWriterConfig( TEST_VERSION_CURRENT, new MockAnalyzer(random)).setMaxBufferedDocs(2).setMergePolicy(newLogMergePolicy()));\n{noformat}\n\nCode is already hard enough to read... we should not make it even\nharder by enabling big hard-to-read compound expressions like this.\n\nThis phenomenon is [unfortunately] human nature, and also well outside\nof software development; see\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_Law_of_Triviality ... the\nless important the ambiguity the more brutal the bike shed wars will\nbe.  You see this also in Theodor Geisel (\"Dr Seuss\")'s delightful\nSneetches (the stars on their stomachs), his Butter Battle Book (which\nside to butter the bread on), which end of the egg to crack (the\nLilliputians in Gulliver's Travels), etc.  It's not an uncommon\nproblem :)\n\nBattles over code styling is a great example of this phenomenon, and\nfortunately we long ago adopted a standard for Lucene so we don't\nargue (much!) about code style.  There is one way and there is no\n(little!) ambiguity left.\n\nSo I don't want to add any more chainable methods in Lucene.  It\ncreates an unnecessary ambiguity and I don't like where that will lead\nus.  We should reduce ambiguity whenever we can: there should\ngenerally be one obvious way to do something.\n",

Can't we\nhave only the Builder, and that returns a MultiReader?\n\nThe problem why we need ParallelCompositeReader is that the refCounting and close logic is different. MultiReader will close/refcount its childs, but the ParallelCompositeReader must close/refcount the parallel sub readers. If you return a simple MultiReader, all tests fail, because something is closing the subreaders of the original parallel Composite/DirectoryReaders (as they are closed by the wrappers), but the original CompositeReaders stay open.\n\nIf the parallel readers are DirectoryReaders it goes very bad, as the wrapped SegmentReaders are closed...\n\nThe change does the following: It returns a BaseMultiReader of ParallelAtomicReaders that wrap e.g. the SegmentReaders of a DirectoryReader. On close it decRefs or closes the original wrapped DirectoryReader, but does not touch the subreaders. In contrast, a normal MultiReader would close/decRef the inner ParallelAtomicReaders, which itsself cose the SegmentReaders they wrap. The DirectoryReaders would still be open.",

It needed a policeman to do this, for all the checks to be correct,\nand good javadocs explaining how to make the composite case work.\n\nSo maybe we should just open a separate issue for the style?

But also here the check is done by the invoked ctors for the wrapped subreaders already.\n\nOtherwise I am not happy with the telescopic ctor (sorry, builder looked better for the expert case - this is now unreadable).\n\nThe good thing is that we could add freedom so storedFieldsReaders can be completely separate.

The whole ParallelReaders structure simply rely on maxDocs identical - not even hasDeletions need to be checked. It should simply be documented that Parallel*Reader takes the liveDocs/hasDeletions from the first reader and ignores livedocs of other readers. \n\nIn 3.x this was more an issue, but in trunk, where liveDocs are completely separated, there is no need to check numDocs.\n\nThe checking of numDocs is also no added safety, because 2 readers can have different liveDocs, but still same numDocs.",
