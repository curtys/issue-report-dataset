    "description": "A user reported that wordnet parses the prolog file incorrectly.\n\nAlso need to check the wordnet parser in the memory contrib for this problem.\n\nIf this is a false alarm, i'm not worried, because the test will be the first unit test wordnet package ever had.\n\n{noformat}\nFor example, looking up the synsets for the\nword \"king\", we get:\n\njava SynLookup wnindex king\nbaron\nmagnate\nmogul\npower\nqueen\nrex\nscrofula\nstruma\ntycoon\n\nHere, \"scrofula\" and \"struma\" are extraneous. This happens because, the line\nparser code in Syns2Index.java interpretes the two consecutive single quotes\nin entry s(114144247,3,'king''s evil',n,1,1) in  wn_s.pl file, as\ntermination\nof the string and separates into \"king\". This entry concerns\nsynset of words \"scrofula\" and \"struma\", and thus they get inserted in the\nsynset of \"king\". *There 1382 such entries, in wn_s.pl* and more in other\nWordNet\nProlog data-base files, where such use of two consecutive single quotes\nappears.\n\nWe have resolved this by adding a statement in the line parsing portion of\nSyns2Index.java, as follows:\n\n           // parse line\n           line = line.substring(2);\n          * line = line.replaceAll(\"\\'\\'\", \"`\"); // added statement*\n           int comma = line.indexOf(',');\n           String num = line.substring(0, comma);  ... ... etc.\nIn short we replace \"''\" by \"`\" (a back-quote). Then on recreating the\nindex, we get:\n\njava SynLookup zwnindex king\nbaron\nmagnate\nmogul\npower\nqueen\nrex\ntycoon\n{noformat}",
