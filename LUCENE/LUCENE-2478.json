DocIdSet.EMPTY_DOCIDSET is used in both cases to denote the empty set even when the filter returned null. By this also the null value is correctly cached without additional containsKey() checks.",

The code or the Javadoc?  Supposing that null really is OK, does this cause any problems with how CachingWrapperFilter is implementing the caching?  I notice it's calling get() and then comparing against null so it wouldn't appear that it can distinguish \"the entry isn't in the cache\" from \"the entry is in the cache but it's null\".",
