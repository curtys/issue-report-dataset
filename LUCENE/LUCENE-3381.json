The cached rewrittenQuery seems like an easy fix (albeit a change that should be documented).  I see your comments in code about averaging out statistics.  That seems like a bigger issue.  Moving away from a static similarity seems like its doable at this stage.  Is the agnostic scoring model support a showstopper?\n",

Sorry, I think these problems should be fixed first!\n\nI acknowledge those are issues to be addressed for more general use and (luckily) do not affect my existing usage of this class. I expect the query-caching issue can be fixed relatively simply. The scoring system issue gets interesting because this fuzzy functionality relies on tweaking IDF in particular. To work across different scoring systems generically I expect IDF-tweakage would need to be made a pluggable aspect of all these scoring strategies e.g. through a common interface. Messy.\n\nThe point of my previous comment was to register that this was one of the queries languishing outside of core that was genuinely in active use. I imagined this would be  useful information if folks are in the process of cleaning out some of the \"dead wood\" (including relegation to a \"useless-but-stored-for-historical-purposes\" pile).  \n",

Messy.\n{quote}\n\nI don't think think we need to do that?\nI added a comment to the source code:\n{noformat}\n    // TODO: generalize this query (at least it should not reuse this static sim!\n    // a better way might be to convert this into multitermquery rewrite methods.\n    // the rewrite method can 'average' the TermContext's term statistics (docfreq,totalTermFreq) \n    // provided to TermQuery, so that the general idea is agnostic to any scoring system...\n{noformat}\n\nI don't think this is really that hard, nor messy? \nThen this Query just invokes rewrite() to a BooleanQuery of ordinary fuzzyqueries, setting its custom rewrite methods (it looks like we need to implement 2 here, depending upon configuration) on each.\n\nThe rewrite methods would average docfreq and totaltermfreq (the only two \"collection-wide\" term statistics lucene supports), and set these in the TermContexts that they pass to TermQuery. Then the concept works for all scoring systems.\n\nAs a side benefit, this would give some performance benefits anyway since by doing this, the term rewrite will become single pass instead of doing wasted seeks per-segment * per-term.\n",

            "body": "It's more nuanced than averaging IDF of variants (as discussed at length in LUCENE-329).\nTo summarise: the original search term is the closest thing we have to the user's intent. If we average its IDF against all fuzzy variants it is most likely to dilute this value with a set of rare terms (most terms in the termEnum are e.g. typos) that happen to share some characters.\nWhen sitting this sort of expanded fuzzy query alongside other search terms in a BooleanQuery (e.g. robert~ OR muir) we end up making the \"robert~\" branch of the query look comparatively rare compared to the straight \"muir\" term thanks to the IDF dilution from a hundred rare \"robert\" variations. In my view the correct fix is to use the root term's IDF only (assuming \"robert\" actually exists in the index otherwise we must drop back to the average of variants).\n\nThat's the trick employed by FuzzyLikeThis that stops my customers complaining about \"bad fuzzy matches\".\n",
