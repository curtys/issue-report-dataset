That's what I thought of this issue in the first place - allow the app to more easily control the size of the buffers used by Lucene. That that IOContext will allow me to set different bufferSizes per the work that Lucene's doing (i.e. merge, search) is a bonus for me :).\n\nI still think bufferSize can be used as a hint by the specific Directory impl, but it should be there.\n\nIf we want to allow control of different buffer sizes per operation, then maybe we can do the following:\n* Set a default buffer size on IOContext.\n* Add a setBufferSize(OpType type, int/long bufferSize)\n* Add getBufferSize(OpType) -- returns the set buffer size, or the default if not set.\n\nI don't think it's too complicated and gives enough control to the application?",

I don't think it has a way to do so without either using a static class, something we try to avoid, or propagating those settings down everywhere, which does not make sense either.\n\nSo, Robert, I think you're right -- bufferSize should not exist on IOContext. A custom Directory impl seems unavoided. So I think it'd be good if we can create a BufferedDirectoryWrapper which wraps a Directory and offers a BufferedIndexInput/OutputWrapper which delegate the necessary calls to the wrapped Directory. We've found ourselves needing to implement that kind of Directory several times already, and it'd be good if Lucene can offer one.\n\nThat Directory would then take IOContext -> bufferSize map/properties/whatever and can take that into account in openInput/createOutput.\n\nIf users will need to impl Directory wrapping, if they want to control buffer sizes, I suggest we make that as painless as possible.",

Are there any resource that I can read to understand the problem in depth ?\nHey, I just marked it as GSoC-able :) so you are free to take it. I would also volunteer to mentor on this issue if mike doesn't want to take it though. Let me try to explain you quickly what this issue is about:\n\nLucene uses Directory as an abstraction on top of the filesystem or RAM or any other storage to write the index data. Yet, Lucene has different \"stages\" where we have different requirements to the underlying storage / directory. When you index documents you eventually flush the index to disk and continue indexing until you created enough \"segments\" on disk that you need to merged them. This operations should if possible not pollute the FS cache since its really just housekeeping. With Java such its currently not possible to use some flags like DIRECT / SEQUENTIAL, this is what we have the native DirectIODirectory implementations in contrib for. Yet, for reading stuff from the index while searching we want to have the FS cache helping us as much as possible so this has again different requriements. What we currently do is that we pass different read buffer sizes to the directory to improve performance. All those kinds of information should be passed to the directory on a IndexInput / IndexOutput (similar to Input and OutputStream just tailored & enhanced for Lucene) basis and this is what this issue is about. \n\nhope that helps.",

If this is the right way to go ?\n\nThanks for the patch man! Good to get started eventually. here are some comments for you patch:\n\n* When I look at IOContext I think it should be a little more sophisticated. What I have in mind is something similar to ScorerContext in org.apache.lucene.search.Weight.java. Some kind of a copy-on-write builder pattern that lets us provide some defaults for Merging, Searching and Indexing so by default we can reuse the same instance in many places. If we follow a this copy on write model we could also make this class non-final to let people customize the context if they needs to.\n* I am not sure if we really need the enumeration in IO Context unless me make decisions based on what an input / output is used for. IMO it might make more sense to have default instances for Searching Indexing and Merging and set the flags like SEQUENTIAL and the buffers to good defaults and only tweak them when we are aware of the context ie. when we pull the input / output. The most of the usecases need good defaults and only some need tweaks but if we hold the use-case information on IOContext some directories might want to be very smart and this might duplicate code. \n* I wonder if it makes sense to bind the IO Context instance to the directory and add a factory to the directory like Directory#getIOContext(Merge|Search|Index) to enable the directory impl to set platform specific defaults. I think that would make things easier and customization would be straight forward.\n* You should add a space after a comma in the arguments list like here: int bufferSize,IOContext context) \n* Enum elements should be CamelCase and start with a leading Uppercase character\n\n\n",

I think you can just use a default context here without changing the constructors. Same is true for SegmentInfos \n* This is unrelated to your patch but in PreFlexFields we should use IndexFileNames.segmentFileName(info.name, \"\", PreFlexCodec.FREQ_EXTENSION) and IndexFileNames.segmentFileName(info.name, \"\", PreFlexCodec.PROX_EXTENSION) instead of info.name + \".frq\"  and info.name + \".prx\"\n* it seems that we should communicate the IOContext to the codec somehow. I suggest we put IOContext to SegmentWriteState and SegmentReadState that way we don't need to change the Codec interface and clutter it with internals. This would also fix mikes comment for FieldsConsumer etc.\n* TermVectorsWriter is only used in Merges so maybe it should also get a Context.Merge for consistency?\n* I really don't like OneMerge :) I think we should add an abstract class  (maybe MergeInfo) that exposes the estimatedMergeBytes, totalDocCount for now.\n* small typo in RamDirectory, there is a space missing after the second file here: dir.copy(this, file, file,context);\n* SegmentReader should also use the static Default IOContext - make sure its used where needed :)\n\nRegarding the IOContext class I think we should design for what we have right now and since SegementInfo is not used anywhere (as far as I can see) we should add it once we need it. OneMerge should not go in there but rather the interface / abstract class I talked about above. ",

EG some\nkind of caching dir (or something) would know not to bother caching\nsuch files...\n\nSame for del docs, terms index, doc values (well, sometimes), etc.\n\nbq. it seems that we should communicate the IOContext to the codec somehow. I suggest we put IOContext to SegmentWriteState and SegmentReadState that way we don't need to change the Codec interface and clutter it with internals.

In this case I think you can simply omit them since they are pretty self explained. I think what we need on MergeInfo as well as on FlushInfo is a javadoc comment that says that the values are estimates not necessarily real / correct values.\n* on private IOContext (Context context, MergeInfo mergeInfo ) I don't understand the assert why is there a context != Flush?\n* in MockDirectoryWrapper there is a nocommit that says randomize the IOContext.

As a future improvement we can add a set/getMergeBufferSize to each Dir impl...",
