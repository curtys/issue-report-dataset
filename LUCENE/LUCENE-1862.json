If everybody thinks something is a good idea, and they don't think it has the reach to affect stability (or undercut the testing that has already occured), I don't see why we wouldn't do it.

Any time I think about it, I just end up thinking its best to leave it ... the javadoc itself (package descriptions) still appears to come out correctly.\n\nUh ... not really.  what you get is non-deterministic behavior, where *one* of the package.html files for each package gets picked, and the other one isn't used. (this can look particularly confusing with something like queryPrser, where you'll find one description in the \"core\" docs, a differnet version in the \"contrib\" docs, and it's a crap shoot as to which one of those will show up in the \"all\" docs.\n\n\n",
