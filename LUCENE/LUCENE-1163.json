I will commit shortly.",

I stumbled upon a bug in CharArraySet while doing that.\n\nThe method _public boolean contains(char[] text, int off, int len)_ seems not to work.\n\nWhen I do \n\n{code}\nif (set.contains(buffer,offset,length) {\n  ...\n}\n{code}\n\nmy code fails.\n\nBut when I do\n\n{code}\nif (set.contains(new String(buffer,offset,length)) {\n   ...\n}\n{code}\n\neverything works as expected.\n\nBoth variants should behave the same. I attach a small piece of code to show the problem.",
