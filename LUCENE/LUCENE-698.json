You are right, we could do that and I was actually\nthinking about it already. The problem is if I make this fix than testFQ7 fails\nfor TestSimpleExplanationsOfNonMatches because it is assumed that all\nnon matching docs have a score of 0.0. I can easily change that, so that non\nmatching docs can either have a score of 0.0 or NaN but I was not sure if we\nwant that, because other scoring bugs resulting in a score of NaN (which we \nwill hopefully never have) wouldn't be noticed then anymore.\n\nThe reason why I argued that testFQ7 is an invalid test case is that it would\nfail for any other query with a boost set to 0. Ironically we have this test\nonly for FilteredQuery, the only query class that ignores the boost, which\nmade it pass in the past.",

Quite cool and elegant idea actually!\n\nI guess then throwing an IllegalArgumentException in case boost=0 would\nbreak this. The question remains if we should fix the scorers to never\nreturn NaN. Hmm, I'm not completely sure how to do this. Maybe \nDefaultSimilarity.queryNorm() should return 0 instead of Infinity in \ncase sumOfSquaredWeights is 0. But then with custom Similarity \nimplemenations we could still end up getting NaN.\n\nA different solution of course is to fix it in the scorers itself, to\nreturn a score of 0 in case boost is 0. But then we'd have to add \nchecks in the score() and explain() methods, which might be a \nperformance overhead.\n\nSo I'm not sure if we should \"fix\" this at all considering these \ndifficulties and the fact that nobody complained (I think?) about the \nNaN so far.\n\nAnyway, I'll go ahead and commit LUCENE-698 since this NaN problem is a \nseparate issue and not only happing for the FilteredQuery.\n",

Then it multiplies boost and queryNorm and 0*Infinity=NaN.\n\nThe bug here to me seems that queryNorm is Infinity.  A boost of zero has a reasonable interpretation (don't influence scoring), but I don't see how a queryNorm of Infinity is ever useful.  So perhaps we can remove the NaN by modifying the default implementation of queryNorm to return 1.0 instead of Infinity when passed zero.  Would that cause any harm?",

It will be the responsibility of people\nwho implement their own Similarity then to take care of this in a similar way.\n\nI'll open a new issue for fixing the DefaultSimilarity.",
