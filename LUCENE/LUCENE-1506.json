Imagine a large index, and the logic to calculate whether it is in the set is non-trivial, so building this DocSet can be expensive.\n\nSo in the case where the driving query produces a very small result set, the validation can be performed only on the small set via the match call. \n\nYes, in terms of functionality, one can do this with a filter, but it is wasteful to perform the validation calculation on the entire index where the candidates to be in the hits set is small.",
