Most, if not all, are somehow directly tied to Solr's Schema concepts.  That in fact seems to be their advantage since the typing information is hugely beneficial.  With Lucene's FieldType work coming up, maybe some of it can be offloaded to those.  We can also work on inverting the APIs in some places, providing abstractions in others.\n\nThat all said, I'm not afraid of trying.\n\n{quote}\nI think most tests only use the QP for convenience, maybe just make a REALLY REALLY simple MockQueryParser that is basically a String.split() for these tests for convenience?

Like, ideally however these problems are being solved (e.g. adding numericrange support to the QP is one example), we could eventually move the solr QPs to use this 'information' and maybe refactor how its own schema works... if it turns out stuff is really solr-specific and not generalizable then keep it in solr.\n\nBut I think as a start, we can consolidate what is in lucene core and contrib, thats a ton of work in itself. \n",

And cutting tests over to a new MockQP, and then simply moving (but not merging) all QPs together to a module, sounds like great first steps.\n\nNote that the FieldType work (at least as currently planned/targetted) isn't a schema -- it's really just a nicer API for working with documents.  Ie, nothing is persisted, nothing checks that 2 docs have the fields / types, etc.\n\nStill, it would be great to pull Solr's QP in and somehow abstract the parts that require access to Solr's schema.",

I think at the least we should put all these QPs into one place to make refactoring between them easier. Then we make a smaller amount of code for these small form factor apps you are so concerned about, with the messy duplication this is not possible now.\n\nI still stand by my comments in LUCENE-2323, and guess what, turns out I think I was right.\nLUCENE-1938 then refactored one of these queryparsers, removing 4000 lines of code but keeping the same functionality.\n",

One option is to just replicate this class in src/test and call it TestingQueryParser.  Another option is to convert all tests over to programmatically building their queries (seems like alot of work).",
