I guess I should do the moveing and commit it,  the refactoring should be done afterwards. Would that make sense to you?!\n\nsimon",

Also new contribs should be added to the developers part in the site docs and so on. I can do that if you like after committing the whole thing (I have done it several times the last months for spatial, trie,...).\n\nAnother idea: We can do it without creating a new contrib, instead do it like the contrib-bdb, which consists of 2 sub-contribs. Here the contrib folder of bdb is divided into two sub-folders, the build.xml of the main folder is just a \"delegator\" (or how you would call it) and delegates the ant targets to the build.xmls in the sub-folders. Using this approach we would still have only one contrib-analyzers main folder with two subdirs, which are two separate contribs modules (like the two bdb ones), but are in one folder.\n\nThis approach is only good for source code, the user still gets the jar files in the main build folder directly under contrib. So I am not sure, if this is really better than two really separate contribs.",

From my understanding the Hidden Markov Model Segmenter is a feature which could be replaced by some other algorithm. Once you have such a feature relationship I would prefer packages by feature which enables you to remove a single feature just by removing a whole package. \nIn other words I would love to see a general refactoring of the code which exploits a tiny but common API in the base package and is subsequently used by the HHMM \"feature\". There is quite a bit of work to do that I do not consider 2.9 work. \nSo here is the question, do we keep the structure as it is and just move it to a new subdir to build a sep. jar or do we move them into one single package (as you did in the patch) and build up a clean HHMM package  later in 3.*. \n\nBeside the packaging I found heaps of things I do not like very much in the code (not your patch :) an my fingertips getting nervous when I see stuff like the AbstractDictionary hierarchy or those Singletions. I would really like to have this separation of CN and common Analyzers in for 2.9 -- we just need to decide which way we go. I guess moving it over without changing code would be easiest.\n\nsimon\n",

But words + bigrams (overlapping tokens), that would be nice.\n\nIn the future it would be nice to add support for traditional chinese, and there is frequency data out there (libtabe: BSD license, etc), but we need to refactor first.\n\nAs far as what to do for 2.9...

I agree with you points I did not look closely into implementation details but rather on structural things. Apparently we both agree that we have work to do on this and I guess we can work out good solutions in the future together. Let's just move the classes into it's own subdir as you already did and keep the structure as it is (with the smallest changes - some classes have to be moved). If you could provide a patch I will commit the refactoring and we open a new issue for 3.*. \nThis solution seems to be ideal as 2.9 release is quite close...\n\n\nsimon",

The dictionary is quite big compared to all the other resouces / class files contained in that jar. \nHaving a separate analyzer-cn contrib project enables footprint-sensitive users (e.g. using lucene on a mobile phone) to include analyzer.jar without getting into trouble with disk space.\n\nMoving SmartChineseAnalyzer to a separate project could also include a small refactoring as Robert mentioned in [LUCENE-1722|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1722] several classes should be package protected, members and classes could be final, commented syserr and logging code should be removed etc.\n\nI set this issue target to 2.9 - if we can not make it until then feel free to move it to 3.0\n",
