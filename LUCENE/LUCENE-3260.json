            "body": "Thanks Shai!\n\nThe 200+ iterations are exceptionally fast since they only do 1 TermsEnum op per iter (it's the indexing that'll be slow in this test -- for that I do numDocs = atLeast(10)).  Also, this bug only happens when seekExact is followed by next, only on certain terms, and only on a multi-seg index.  So it seems an OK investment of CPU for test coverage ;)",
