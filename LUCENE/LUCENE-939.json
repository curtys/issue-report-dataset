That's\nwhy -1 is stored as field number for this term in the \ndictionary. If we could avoid storing the empty term then we\ncould also get rid of these checks in FieldInfos. When I \nhave some time I'll look into that and add a separate issue.\n\nAll tests pass with this patch.",

    "description": "In FieldInfos there are three methods in which we don't check for\nboundary conditions but catch e. g. an IndexOutOfBoundsException\nor a NPE. I think this isn't good code style and is probably not\neven faster than checking explicitly.\n\n\"Exceptions should not be used to alter the flow of a program as \npart of normal execution.\"\n\nAlso this can be irritating when you're trying to debug an \nIndexOutOfBoundsException that is thrown somewhere else in your\nprogram and you place a breakpoint on that exception.\n\nThe three methods are:\n\n  public int fieldNumber(String fieldName) {\n    try {\n      FieldInfo fi = fieldInfo(fieldName);\n      if (fi != null)\n        return fi.number;\n    }\n    catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException ioobe) {\n      return -1;\n    }\n    return -1;\n  }\n  \n\n  public String fieldName(int fieldNumber) {\n    try {\n      return fieldInfo(fieldNumber).name;\n    }\n    catch (NullPointerException npe) {\n      return \"\";\n    }\n  }\n  \n  \n  public FieldInfo fieldInfo(int fieldNumber) {\n    try {\n      return (FieldInfo) byNumber.get(fieldNumber);\n    }\n    catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException ioobe) {\n      return null;\n    }\n  }",
