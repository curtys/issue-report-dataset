(btw, we do not need to add the casts for trunk, as it uses java 5, but if/when backported to 2.9.x we can add them).\n\nI think we need to do the same thing with NGramTokenFilter, it looks broken too in the same way. I'll take your patch and see if i can add fixes to that one too... and both these filters need better tests to ensure these offsets work.\n\nThanks for the bug report and the fix!",

    "description": "i ran into a problem while using the edgengramtokenfilter, it seems to report incorrect offsets when generating tokens, more specifically all the tokens have offset 0 and term length as start and end, this leads to goofy highlighting behavior when creating edge grams for tokens beyond the first one, i created a small patch that takes into account the start of the original token and adds that to the reported start/end offsets.\n\n",
