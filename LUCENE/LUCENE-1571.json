I did some debugging and I confirmed that it is bombing on a document that is marked as deleted (using Luke).\n\n\nThanks!\n\nUsing the locallucene library 1.51, I get a NullPointerException at line 123 of DistanceFilter\nThe method is \tpublic BitSet bits(IndexReader reader) \nThe line is double x = NumberUtils.SortableStr2double(sx);\n\nThe stack trace is:\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat org.apache.solr.util.NumberUtils.SortableStr2long(NumberUtils.java:149)\n\tat org.apache.solr.util.NumberUtils.SortableStr2double(NumberUtils.java:104)\n\tat com.pjaol.search.geo.utils.DistanceFilter.bits(DistanceFilter.java:123)\n\tat org.apache.lucene.search.Filter.getDocIdSet(Filter.java:49)\n\tat org.apache.lucene.search.IndexSearcher.search(IndexSearcher.java:140)\n\tat org.apache.lucene.search.IndexSearcher.search(IndexSearcher.java:112)\n\tat org.apache.lucene.search.Hits.getMoreDocs(Hits.java:113)\n\tat org.apache.lucene.search.Hits.<init>(Hits.java:90)\n\tat org.apache.lucene.search.Searcher.search(Searcher.java:72)",
