            "body": "Attached patch.  All tests pass.  This is just the first step, which\nis to remove autoCommit from IW's public APIs, and fix all places that\nwere using those APIs.\n\nSecond step is to remove autoCommit from inside IW.\n\nWhen there were tests testing both aC=false and true, I just remove\nthe \"true\" case.  When the test was only testing aC=true, I switched\nit to false, and sometimes had to tweak the test (eg to insert calls\nto IW.commit) to make it happy.  For one test, when I did this\n(TestIndexWriter.testImmediateDiskFullWithThreads) it uncovered a\nlatent bug in IW where if an IOException is hit on building the cfx\nfile for flushed doc stores, we were missing a call to\ndocWriter.abort().\n\nI also removed autoCommit from the alg files in\ncontrib/benchmark/conf, fixed up the javadocs, and removed some unused\nimports.\n\nI plan to commit soon!\n",
