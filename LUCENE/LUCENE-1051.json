I think we need to put GData in before committing.\n{quote}\n\nGData has build files that don't extend common-build.xml, so there's always extra work that needs to be done when we add a new feature to our build (like maven artifacts or these javadocs improvements). It doesn't seem that Simon is still around, but we should decide on how we're going to maintain gdata. I'll open a new issue for that and not put GData in this patch.\n\n{quote}\nAlso, I don't know ANT well enough, but is there anyway to have it automatically do the contrib packages without having to explicitly specify it? Just one less thing to remember to add when adding new contrib packages. If it's not a quick fix, don't worry about.\n{quote}\n\nHmm, not sure how to do that. There's a TODO comment in the build file for a long time. I think I'll commit this patch and we can simplify that in the future if someone knows who to do this with Ant.",

    "description": "A while ago we had a discussion on java-dev about separating the javadocs\nfor the contrib modules instead of having only one big javadoc containing \nthe core and contrib classes.\n\nThis patch:\n* Adds new targets to build.xml: \n  ** \"javadocs-all\" Generates Javadocs for the core, demo, and contrib \n    classes\n  ** \"javadocs-core\" Generates Javadocs for the core classes\n  ** \"javadocs-demo\" Generates Javadocs for the demo classes\n  ** \"javadocs-contrib\" Using contrib-crawl it generates the Javadocs for \n    all contrib modules, except \"similarity\" (currently empty) and gdata.\n* Adds submenues to the Javadocs link on the Lucene site with links to\n  the different javadocs\n* Includes the javadocs in the maven artifacts\n\nRemarks:\n- I removed the ant target \"javadocs-internal\", because I didn't want to\n  add corresponding targets for all new javadocs target. Instead I \n  defined a new property \"javadoc.access\", so now  \n  \"ant -Djavadoc.access=package\" can be used in combination with any of\n  the javadocs targets. Is this ok?\n- I didn't include gdata (yet) because it uses build files that don't \n  extend Lucenes standard build files.\n  \nHere's a preview:\nhttp://people.apache.org/~buschmi/site-preview/index.html\n\nPlease let me know what you think about these changes!",
