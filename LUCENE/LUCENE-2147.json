            "body": "Chris, good stuff so far.\nI have added a couple of final keywords and prevent some autoboxing in GeoHashUtils as the char / int values should be mainly cached anyway. this prevents a couple of object creations.\nI also added a testcase which relates to the weird precision issues in LUCENE-1815 that seem to be gone now - good stuff! -> btw I like that we have only one decode method instead of the precision one.\n\nAt the current state I found that the SpatialConstants should be part of DistanceUnits provided as getters. This might change in the future if there are more constants but for now I would rather put them into the enum as this enforces consistency for distance units.\n\nthoughts?",

            "body": "Hi,\n\nYeah you are right about DistanceUnits using the SpatialConstants.  I would like to leave SpatialConstants in as it gives us a single place to manage these values, particularly if the values are dependent on eachother (for example the circumference should really depend on the radius).  However adding to DistanceUnits getEarthRadius() and getEarthCircumference() would make alot of sense in the current environment.  These could then simply pull their values from the SpatialConstants.\n\nI am fine with removing SpatialConstants if you feel this is overkill.",

I think it would make sense to keep a warning that contrib/spatial might slightly change in the future.\nOn the other hand we should try to put more confidence into contrib/spatial for more user acceptance. I currently work for customers that moved away from spatial due to its early stage and \"flux\" warnings which is quite understandable though. I would like to hear other opinions regarding this topic - especially opinions of more experienced committers would be appreciated.",

    "description": "- DistanceUnits can be improved by giving functionality to the enum, such as being able to convert between different units, and adding tests.  \n\n- GeoHashUtils can be improved through some code tidying, documentation, and tests.\n\n- SpatialConstants allows us to move all constants, such as the radii and circumferences of Earth, to a single consistent location that we can then use throughout the contrib.  This also allows us to improve the transparency of calculations done in the contrib, as users of the contrib can easily see the values being used.  Currently this issues does not migrate classes to use these constants, that will happen in issues related to the appropriate classes.",
