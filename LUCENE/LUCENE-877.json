    "description": "I am in the process to migrate from Lucene 2.0 to Lucene 2.1.\n\nFrom reading the Changes document I understand that the write locks are now written into the index folder instead of the java.io.tmpdir. \n\nIn the \"Apache Lucene - Index File Formats\" document in section \"6.2 Lock File\" I read that there is a write lock used to indicate that another process is writing into the index and that this file is stored in the java.io.tempdir.\n\nThis is confusing to me.  I had the impression all lock files go into the index folder now.  And using the the java.io.tempdir is only local and does not support access to shared index folders.\n\nDo I miss something here or is the documentation not updated?\n",
