Just added some missing links, fixed a broken link, tightened up wording, etc.  I'll attach a patch.\n\nAlso a couple random questions:\n\n  * Should this go into the Wiki or into the Web site?  Is there a general criteria / guideline that we've converged on for Wiki vs Web site?\n\n  * Is there a reason why we are linking to the \"ViewVC\" page in the Big Picture section?  Can't we just link to the javadoc?\n\n  * Should we change the title / purpose to be an overview of the Query classes and also details of scoring?  I think the Query Classes section is a great intro to the different Query classes.",

My concern would be external links into the wiki that reference the old jakarata url. I guess we could find out if they can handle a redirect from jakarata-lucene/* to lucene/*?",

The wiki is the hardest to keep in sync with the code, since it is not versioned with the code.  We website is somewhere between: it is in subversion, but in separate files in a separate tree.\n\nThe javadoc is thus the preferred location for documentation that is specific to the code.  The website and wiki are better for stuff that's specific to the project: policys, procedures, etc.  The wiki is great for user-generated stuff like benchmarks, porting tricks, use cases, etc.\n\nThis stuff seems pretty closely tied to the code, so I'd put it in the javadoc.

            "body": "Hi Doron,\n\nThanks for the updates.  I like the content in scoring.xml, although I am inclined to place it after boosts have been introduced in the Scoring Formula section (what do you think?  No need to send a new patch if you agree, I can take care of it)\n\nOn the Similarity changes, I think I like them, but would like to hear from other people. One of the problems I had with the old writing of the formula is it is a bit hard to  tell whether the coord factor is inside the sum or not at first glance and I always have to think about the theory a bit before being sure.  With your formula, it is much clearer.  You also have some nice explanations, but I also feel it takes a bit longer to get an understanding of the formula b/c you introduce some new factors (normalizer, searchBoost, indexBoost) that require an extra layer of indirection (but maybe it is just b/c I am late and I'm tired and need to take a fresh look this weekend).\n\nI think the scoring.xml and Similarity.java formulas should be kept in sync.  Ideally we could do some type of include and only have one file with the formula, but I am not sure how to do this given the current documentation frameworks.\n\nAlso, I think you need a link on the indexBoost factor to the indexBoost anchor (but again, I can take care of that if others are in favor of this part of the patch).\n\nSo, in summary, I am +1 on part 1 of this patch and am all for applying that, but after the Scoring Formula section.  Part 1 can be applied separately from part 2 and I will do so this weekend unless I hear objections otherwise.\n\nThe 2nd part, I am +0.5, if there is such a thing.  I really like the added explanation and the organization of the formula, but am not sure on the searchBoost, indexBoost and normalizer factors and would like to hear from others what they favor.\n\n-Grant",

I am not convinced we need a new term here.\n\nI think 'norm' is a good term for the product of lengthNorm(d) and field boost.  That's what it is called consistently in the code and API.  This quantity is represented in two places, but seems like a logical candidate for the sort of factoring done here.

            "body": "I played with including the formula from a separate file, Client Side Include. \n\n=== Summary === \n I think the \"include\" is not going to work well enough and hence not worth to invest in it.\nSo, bottom line, I give up for now on \"include\", and so I will make the changes in Similarity.java.\n\n=== Details  === \nI know of 3 ways to do this: Javascript, Iframe, Object-Embed. \n\nIframe can work for both the javadocs and the xdocs - I think that Embed also would work though I did not try it.\n\nBoth Iframe and Embed have a problem of appearance: you have to decide on the size of the frame showm, in pixels. If you set too large an area, blank space will remain. If you set a too small area, scroll bars would show up. If the user changes the text side, the required area size is changing, but not the allocated area, so scrollbars or blank space are showing up and disapearing. Very ugly. \n\nIframe also has an issue with inner links navigation: once you navigate to an anchor text in the iframe part (this works), the back action from some reason does not work (both Firefox and IE).\n\nThe javascript approach should not have these issues, because the imported text becomes part of the embedding page (the imported text is \"dynamically generated\"). I saw that Javadocs themselves use javascript (at least in 1.5) so I feel better with using this. However to use Javascript you have to put some javascript code in the HTML Header, as well as an onload event in the BODY tag. I didn't find a way to do this with Javadocs. \n\n(Another tricky issue with Javascript is that outgoing links from the imported text have the base address of the embedding page. So references going out from the embedded text should be different in Similarity.html and Scoring.html (which are in separate directories). But I think this can be resolved with passing a 'base' param to the include() function.)\n\nBottom line, I give up for now on \"include\", and so I will make the changes in Similarity.java.",
