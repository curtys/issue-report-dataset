One thing about this code that should also be corrected ASAP is that if you have a custom dictionary directory in .DCT format, the load() method will actually call save()\n\nThis will create a corresponding .MEM file in the same directory after loading the dictionary in DCT format.\n\nI really do not think load() methods should be creating or writing to files.\n",

If you want to quicker load the files later, you could also save the DCT as a serialized object after that, but this should be left to the user and not done automatically.",
