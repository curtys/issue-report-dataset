    "description": "Our default terms index today breaks terms into blocks of fixed size\n(ie, every 32 terms is a new block), and then we build an index on top\nof that (holding the start term for each block).\n\nBut, it should be better to instead break terms according to how they\nshare prefixes.  This results in variable sized blocks, but means\nwithin each block we maximize the shared prefix and minimize the\nresulting terms index.  It should also be a speedup for terms dict\nintensive queries because the terms index becomes a \"true\" prefix\ntrie, and can be used to fast-fail on term lookup (ie returning\nNOT_FOUND without having to seek/scan a terms block).\n\nHaving a true prefix trie should also enable much faster intersection\nwith automaton (but this will be a new issue).\n\nI've made an initial impl for this (called\nBlockTreeTermsWriter/Reader).  It's still a work in progress... lots\nof nocommits, and hairy code, but tests pass (at least once!).\n\nI made two new codecs, temporarily called StandardTree, PulsingTree,\nthat are just like their counterparts but use this new terms dict.\n\nI added a new \"exactOnly\" boolean to TermsEnum.seek.  If that's true\nand the term is NOT_FOUND, we will (quickly) return NOT_FOUND and the\nenum is unpositioned (ie you should not call next(), docs(), etc.).\n\nIn this approach the index and dict are tightly connected, so it does\nnot support a pluggable index impl like BlockTermsWriter/Reader.\nBlocks are stored on certain nodes of the prefix trie, and can contain\nboth terms and pointers to sub-blocks (ie, if the block is not a leaf\nblock).  So there are two trees, tied to one another -- the index\ntrie, and the blocks.  Only certain nodes in the trie map to a block\nin the block tree.\n\nI think this algorithm is similar to burst tries\n(http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.18.3499),\nexcept it allows terms to be stored on inner blocks (not just leaf\nblocks).  This is important for Lucene because an [accidental]\n\"adversary\" could produce a terms dict with way too many blocks (way\ntoo much RAM used by the terms index).  Still, with my current patch,\nan adversary can produce too-big blocks... which we may need to fix,\nby letting the terms index not be a true prefix trie on it's leaf\nedges.\n\nExactly how the blocks are picked can be factored out as its own\npolicy (but I haven't done that yet).  Then, burst trie is one policy,\nmy current approach is another, etc.  The policy can be tuned to\nthe terms' expected distribution, eg if it's a primary key field and\nyou only use base 10 for each character then you want block sizes of\nsize 10.  This can make a sizable difference on lookup cost.\n\nI modified the FST Builder to allow for a \"plugin\" that freezes the\n\"tail\" (changed suffix) of each added term, because I use this to find\nthe blocks.\n",
