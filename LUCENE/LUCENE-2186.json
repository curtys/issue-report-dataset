This patch adds a\nBytesRef, which does the same thing as flex's TermRef (we should merge\nthem).\n{quote}\n\nIt looks like ByteRef is very similar to Payload? Could you use that instead \nand extend it with the new String constructor and compare methods? \n\n{quote}\nIt handles 3 types of values:\n{quote}\n\nSo it looks like with your approach you want to support certain\n\"primitive\" types out of the box, such as byte[], float, int, String?\nIf someone has custom data types, then they have, similar as with\npayloads today, the byte[] indirection? \n\nThe code I initially wrote for 1231 exposed IndexOutput, so that one\ncan call write*() directly, without having to convert to byte[]\nfirst. I think we will also want to do that for 2125 (store attributes\nin the index). So I'm wondering if this and 2125 should work\nsimilarly? \nThinking out loud: Could we have then attributes with\nserialize/deserialize methods for primitive types, such as float?\nCould we efficiently use such an approach all the way up to\nFieldCache? It would be compelling if you could store an attribute as\nCSF, or in the postinglist, retrieve it from the flex APIs, and also\nfrom the FieldCache. All would be the same API and there would only be\none place that needs to \"know\" about the encoding (the attribute).\n\n{quote}\nNext step is to do basic integration with Lucene, and then compare\nsort performance of this vs field cache.\n{quote}\n\nYeah, that's where I got kind of stuck with 1231: We need to figure\nout how the public API should look like, with which a user can add CSF\nvalues to the index and retrieve them. The easiest and fastest way\nwould be to add a dedicated new API. The cleaner one would be to make the whole\nDocument/Field/FieldInfos API more flexible. LUCENE-1597 was a first attempt.\n\n{quote}\nThere are abstract Writer/Reader classes. The current reader impls\nare entirely RAM resident (like field cache), but the API is (I think)\nagnostic, ie, one could make an MMAP impl instead.\n\nI think this is the first baby step towards LUCENE-1231. Ie, it\ncannot yet update values, and the reading API is fully random-access\nby docID (like field cache), not like a posting list, though I\ndo think we should add an iterator() api (to return flex's DocsEnum)\n{quote}\n\nHmm, so random-access would obviously be the preferred approach for SSDs, but\nwith conventional disks I think the performance would be poor? In 1231\nI implemented the var-sized CSF with a skip list, similar to a posting\nlist. I think we should add that here too and we can still keep the\nadditional index that stores the pointers? We could have two readers:\none that allows random-access and loads the pointers into RAM (or uses\nMMAP as you mentioned), and a second one that doesn't load anything\ninto RAM, uses the skip lists and only allows iterator-based access?\n\nAbout updating CSF: I hope we can use parallel indexing for that. In\nother words: It should be possible for users to use parallel indexes\nto update certain fields, and Lucene should use the same approach\ninternally to store different \"generations\" of things like norms and CSFs.",

            "body": "bq. Is this patch for flex, as it contains CodecUtils and so on?\n\nActually it's intended for trunk; I was thinking this should land\nbefore flex (it's a much smaller change, and it's \"isolated\" from\nflex), and so I wrote the CodecUtil/BytesRef basic infrastructure,\nthinking flex would then cutover to them.\n\n{quote}\nHmm, so random-access would obviously be the preferred approach for SSDs, but\nwith conventional disks I think the performance would be poor?

Ie, it's\n\"meant\" to be a RAM resident (either via explicit slurping-into-RAM or\nvia MMAP).  So the SSD or spinning magnets should not be hit on\nretrieval.\n\nIf we add an iterator API, I think it should be simpler than the\npostings API (ie, no seeking, dense (every doc is visited,\nsequentially) iteration).\n\n{quote}\nIt looks like ByteRef is very similar to Payload? Could you use that instead \nand extend it with the new String constructor and compare methods?\n{quote}\n\nGood point!  I agree.  Also, we should use BytesRef when reading the\npayload from TermsEnum.  Actually I think Payload, BytesRef, TermRef\n(in flex) should all eventually be merged; of the three names, I think\nI like BytesRef the best.  With *Enum in flex we can switch to\nBytesRef.  For analysis we should switch PayloadAttribute to BytesRef,\nand deprecate the methods using Payload?  Hmmm... but PayloadAttribute\nis an interface.\n\n{quote}\nSo it looks like with your approach you want to support certain\n\"primitive\" types out of the box, such as byte[], float, int, String?\n{quote}\n\nActually, all \"primitive\" types (ie, byte/short/int/long are\n\"included\" under int, as well as arbitrary bit precision \"between\"\nthose primitive types).  Because the API uses a method invocation (eg\nIntSource.get) instead of direct array access, we can \"hide\" how many\nbits are actually used, under the impl.  Same is true for float/double\n(except we can't [easily] do arbitrary bit precision here... just 4 or\n8 bytes).\n\n{quote}\nIf someone has custom data types, then they have, similar as with\npayloads today, the byte[] indirection?\n{quote}\n\nRight, byte[] is for String, but also for arbitrary (opaque to Lucene)\nextensibility.  The six anonymous (separate package private classes)\nconcrete impls should give good efficiency to fit the different use\ncases.\n\n{quote}\nThe code I initially wrote for 1231 exposed IndexOutput, so that one\ncan call write*() directly, without having to convert to byte[]\nfirst. I think we will also want to do that for 2125 (store attributes\nin the index). So I'm wondering if this and 2125 should work\nsimilarly?\n{quote}\n\nThis is compelling (letting Attrs read/write directly), but, I have\nsome questions:\n\n  * How would the random-access API work?  (Attrs are designed for\n    iteration).  Eg, just providing IndexInput/Output to the Attr\n    isn't quite enough -- the encoding is sometimes context dependent\n    (like frq writes the delta between docIDs, the symbol table needed\n    when reading/writing deref/sorted).  How would I build a random\n    access API on top of that?  captureState-per-doc is too costly.\n    What API would be used to write the shared state, ie, to tell the\n    Attr \"we now are writing the segment, so you need to dump the\n    symbol table\".\n\n  * How would the packed ints work?  EG say my ints only need 5 bits.\n    (Attrs are sort of designed for one-value-at-once).\n\n  * How would the \"symbol table\" based encodings (deref, sorted) work?\n    I guess the attr would need to have some state associated with\n    it, and when I first create the attr I need to pass it segment\n    name, Directory, etc, so it opens the right files?\n\n  * I'm thinking we should still directly support native types, ie,\n    Attrs are there for extensibility beyond native types?\n\n  * Exposing single attr across a multi reader sounds tricky --\n    LUCENE-2154 (and, we need this for flex, which is worrying me!).\n    But it sounds like you and Uwe are making some progress on that\n    (using some under-the-hood Java reflection magic)... and this\n    doesn't directly affect this issue, assuming we don't expose this\n    API at the MultiReader level.\n\n{quote}\nThinking out loud: Could we have then attributes with\nserialize/deserialize methods for primitive types, such as float?\nCould we efficiently use such an approach all the way up to\nFieldCache? It would be compelling if you could store an attribute as\nCSF, or in the postinglist, retrieve it from the flex APIs, and also\nfrom the FieldCache. All would be the same API and there would only be\none place that needs to \"know\" about the encoding (the attribute).\n{quote}\n\nThis is the grand unification of everything :)  I like it, but, I\ndon't want that future utopia to stall our progress today... ie I'd\nrather do something simple yet concrete, now, and then work step by\nstep towards that future (\"progress not perfection\").\n\nThat said, if we can get some bite sized step in, today, towards that\nfuture, that'd be good.\n\nEg, the current patch only supports \"dense\" storage, ie it's assumed\nevery document will have a value, because it's aiming to replace field\ncache.  If we wanted to add sparse storage... I think that'd\nrequire/strongly encourage access via a postings-like iteration API,\nwhich I don't see how to take a baby step towards :)\n\nI do think it would be compelling for an Attr to \"only\" have to expose\nread/write methods, and then the Attr can be stored in CSF or\npostings, but I don't see how to make an efficient random-access API\non top of that.  I think it's in LUCENE-2125 where we should explore\nthis.\n\nNorms and deleted docs should be able to eventually switch to CSF.\n\nIn fact, norms should just be a FloatSource, with default impl being\nthe 1-byte float encoding we use today.  This then gives apps full\nflexibility to plugin their own FloatSource.\n\nFor deleted docs we should probably create a BoolSource.\n\n{quote}\nAbout updating CSF: I hope we can use parallel indexing for that. In\nother words: It should be possible for users to use parallel indexes\nto update certain fields, and Lucene should use the same approach\ninternally to store different \"generations\" of things like norms and\nCSFs.\n{quote}\n\nThat sounds great, though, I think we need a more efficient way to\nstore the changes.  Ie, norms rewrites all norms on any change, which\nis costly.  It'd be better to have some sort of delta format, where\nyou sparsely encode docID + new value, and then when loading we merge\nthose on the fly (and, segment merging periodically also merges &\ncommits them).\n\n{quote}\nYeah, that's where I got kind of stuck with 1231: We need to figure\nout how the public API should look like, with which a user can add CSF\nvalues to the index and retrieve them. The easiest and fastest way\nwould be to add a dedicated new API. The cleaner one would be to make the whole\nDocument/Field/FieldInfos API more flexible. LUCENE-1597 was a first attempt.\n{quote}\n\nRight, but LUCENE-1597 is another good but far-away-from-landing\ngoal.  I think a dedicated API is fine for the atomic types.  Field\ncache today is a dedicated API...\n\nI guess to sum up my thoughts now (but I'm still mulling...):\n\n  * I think the random-access-field-cache-like-API should be separate\n    from the designed-for-iteration-from-a-file postings API.\n\n  * Attrs for extensibilty could be compelling, but I don't see how to\n    build an [efficient] random access API on top of Attrs.  It would\n    be very elegant only having to add a read/write method to your\n    Attr, but, that's not really enough for a full codec.\n\n  * I don't think we should hold up adding direct support for atomic\n    types until/if we can figure out how to add Attrs.  Ie I think we\n    should do this in two steps.  The current patch is [roughly] step\n    1, and I think should be a compelling replacement for field cache.\n    Memory usage and GC cost of string sorting should be much lower\n    than field cache.\n\nI'm also still mulling on these issues w/ the current patch:\n\n  * How could we use index values to efficiently maintain stats needed\n    for flexible scoring (LUCENE-2187).\n\n  * Current patch doesn't handle merging yet.\n\n  * Could norms/deleted docs \"conceivably\" cutover to index values\n    API?\n\n  * What \"dedicated API\" for indexing & sorting.\n\n  * Run basic perf tests to see cost of using method instead of direct\n    array.\n",

This is how you can index CSF with this Attribute approach:\n\n{code} \n    RAMDirectory dir = new RAMDirectory();\n    IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(dir, new IndexWriterConfig(Version.LUCENE_40, new SimpleAnalyzer(Version.LUCENE_40)));\n    Document doc = new Document();\n    Fieldable fieldable = new AttributeField(\"myIntField\");\n    ValuesAttribute valuesAttribute = fieldable.attributes().addAttribute(ValuesAttribute.class);\n    valuesAttribute.setType(Values.PACKED_INTS);\n    valuesAttribute.ints().set(100);\n    doc.add(fieldable);    \n    writer.addDocument(doc);\n    writer.close();\n{code}\n  \nThis is how get the values back via source or the ValuesEnum:\n\n{code}\n    IndexReader reader = IndexReader.open(dir);\n    // this might be integrated into Fields eventually\n    Reader indexValues = reader.getIndexValues(\"myIntField\"); // can get cached version too via reader.getIndexValuesCache();\n    Source load = indexValues.load();\n    long value = load.ints(0);\n    System.out.println(value);\n\n    // or get it from the enum\n    ValuesEnum intEnum = indexValues.getEnum();\n    ValuesAttribute attr = intEnum.getAttribute(ValuesAttribute.class);\n    while(intEnum.nextDoc() != ValuesEnum.NO_MORE_DOCS) {\n      System.out.println(attr.ints().get());\n    }\n{code}\n\nI guess this should make it at least easier to get started. I actually expect people saying {{ValuesEnum}} looks very much like {{DocsEnum}} which is certainly correct. Yet, I didn't integrate {{ValuesEnum}} into {{Fields}} etc. for simplicity as changes to {{Fields}} touches lot of code. Having {{ValuesEnum}} being a \"stand-alone\" API makes iterating and development easier and a cut over to DocsEnum would be easy API wise as it already implements {{DocIdSetIterator}}. \n\nWith that in mind, the use of {{ValuesAttribute}} makes sense too - with a stand-also API this would be obsolet and could be direct part of {{ValuesEnum}}.\n\nWhat I don't like about {{DocsEnum}} is the {{BulkReadResult}} class and its relative being a first class citizen in {{DocsEnum}}. With CSF not every {{DocsEnum}} iterates over <id,freq>* - but maybe we can move that to an attribute and make a more general abstract class.  The Attributes on those enums don't introduce a real overhead but solve lots of extendability problems though.",

LUCENE-2125 has different problems to tackle first I guess - but I am closely following that!

I was too lazy to add all the capabilities {BytesRef} has but I could imagine that this can benefit from being able to hold more values - maybe a entire page when paging is used.  If it only holds a single value we don't need offset and length too. I will leaf it like that for now, can still change it later if it turns out that we don't need this flexibility.\n\nI guess I will move the ValuesEnum down to Fields and FieldsEnum soon. I don't think we should confuse this with an DocsEnum since DocsEnum is so closely related to Terms and has explicit getters for freq() though.

We have 47 nocommit pending where about the half of it can be TODOs while the other half of it are rather easy task and should be fixed before we go to trunk.\nThese are the major steps I would like to finish until we land this on trunk\n\n* Implement bulk copies for merging where possible. Currently there are still some value types not bulk copied and the ones which are only do if there are no deletes. Yet, the deletes thing I would make a TODO for now - we can still make that more efficient once we are on trunk. If I recall correctly figuring out the next deleted document is still a linear problem (I need to iterate through deletes), right? I guess that would be easier if I could figure out the next one so see if bulks are reasonable - maybe an invalid concern though.\n\n* Exposing the API via Fields / IndexReader. I think we should expose the Iterator API via Fields just like Terms is today. Currently it doesn't feel very natural to get the ValuesEnum via IR.\n* Rethink the Source API - I get the feeling that we don't really need the Source class but could rather use a Random Access Enum like Terms where we can see back and forth depending on how we loaded the fields values. We could actually unify the iterator API and random access which would catch two birds with one stone. internally we simply use the *Refs to set the actual values, default values would no be needed anymore (would save some code / branches internally) and the user would not have to access two different APIs. Additionally we could expose bulk reads just like BulkReadResult in DocsEnum to obtain all values in an array. Maybe if we wanna populate FieldsCache from it. I think we won't have perf. losts due to that since there is not really an overhead compared to the get() call on Source. - Reminds me I need to think about how we use that with sorted values.... If we keep Source we should at least make it implement ValuesEnum so we can use it as enumeration if they are in mem already.\n\n* To do merging for byte values correctly we need to figure out how to specify the comparator for each field. I don't have a concrete idea for this but I think this should somehow go into IndexWriterConfig in a per field map. Thougths?\n\n\nRemaining nocommits could be converted into TODOs - I think we can do so with the following\n\n* Evaluate if we can decide if a Bytes Payload should be stored as straight or as fixed which would make it easier for the user to use the byte variants.\n* Evaluate if we need String variants or if they can simple be solved with the byte ones\n* We should have some king of compatibility notion so that slightly different segments can be merged like fixed vs. var bytes float32 vs. float64.\n* For a cleaner transition we should create a sep. SortField that always uses index values.\n* explore a better way to obtain all dat / idx fiels in SegmentInfo to do segment merges for index values.\n* BytesValueProcessor should be thread private but I will leave that as a todo since this code might change anyway once realtime lands on trunk though. Not super urgent for now.\n* Fix some exception handling issues especially in MultiSource & MultiValuesEnum\n* Fix the singed / unsigned limitations in Ints implementation\n* Explore ways to preven Ints impl do two method calls maybe we can expose PackedInts directly somehow\n\nbq.

    "description": "I created an initial basic impl for storing \"index values\" (ie\ncolumn-stride value storage).  This is still a work in progress... but\nthe approach looks compelling.  I'm posting my current status/patch\nhere to get feedback/iterate, etc.\n\nThe code is standalone now, and lives under new package\noal.index.values (plus some util changes, refactorings) -- I have yet\nto integrate into Lucene so eg you can mark that a given Field's value\nshould be stored into the index values, sorting will use these values\ninstead of field cache, etc.\n\nIt handles 3 types of values:\n\n  * Six variants of byte[] per doc, all combinations of fixed vs\n    variable length, and stored either \"straight\" (good for eg a\n    \"title\" field), \"deref\" (good when many docs share the same value,\n    but you won't do any sorting) or \"sorted\".\n\n  * Integers (variable bit precision used as necessary, ie this can\n    store byte/short/int/long, and all precisions in between)\n\n  * Floats (4 or 8 byte precision)\n\nString fields are stored as the UTF8 byte[].  This patch adds a\nBytesRef, which does the same thing as flex's TermRef (we should merge\nthem).\n\nThis patch also adds basic initial impl of PackedInts (LUCENE-1990);\nwe can swap that out if/when we get a better impl.\n\nThis storage is dense (like field cache), so it's appropriate when the\nfield occurs in all/most docs.  It's just like field cache, except the\nreading API is a get() method invocation, per document.\n\nNext step is to do basic integration with Lucene, and then compare\nsort performance of this vs field cache.\n\nFor the \"sort by String value\" case, I think RAM usage & GC load of\nthis index values API should be much better than field caache, since\nit does not create object per document (instead shares big long[] and\nbyte[] across all docs), and because the values are stored in RAM as\ntheir UTF8 bytes.\n\nThere are abstract Writer/Reader classes.  The current reader impls\nare entirely RAM resident (like field cache), but the API is (I think)\nagnostic, ie, one could make an MMAP impl instead.\n\nI think this is the first baby step towards LUCENE-1231.  Ie, it\ncannot yet update values, and the reading API is fully random-access\nby docID (like field cache), not like a posting list, though I\ndo think we should add an iterator() api (to return flex's DocsEnum)\n-- eg I think this would be a good way to track avg doc/field length\nfor BM25/lnu.ltc scoring.\n",
