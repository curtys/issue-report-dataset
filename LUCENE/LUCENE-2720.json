This is fine for 3.1 and onwards indexes, however what do we do w/ 3.0 ones? We will need to distinguish >=3.1 and <3.1. However, <3.1 covers both 3.0 (which we should support by 4.0) and 2.9 (which we shouldn't). Maybe this isn't a problem because you cannot upgrade from 2.9 to 4.0 directly - you have to go through 3.x.\n\nBTW Mike, I think we should track the version per-segment because only when all segments of version X are gone, can the minimum version Y be recorded in segments_N. That is, if you have several segments from version 1, and the index is on version 2, and you merge some of the ver1 segments, the index's oldest version is still 1. However, if you record it only in segments_N, how would you know when *all* ver1 segments are gone?",

I think we can just use the stored fields file, since it changed as of 3.0?",

I think we can just use the stored fields file, since it changed as of 3.0?\n\nWe discussed this in IRC shortly before:\nTo detect a pre-3.0 index, it's enough to read the StoredFields file (is it really *always* available?). So 3.x and 4.0 do the following in the ctors/open:\n- if segments file is 3.x format, it contains information about util.Version -> we are fine no more work. In 4.0 we are happy with the index\n- Only trunk: if segments file is older format, read the StoredFields file in ctor. This would throw IndexFormatTooOldEx in 4.0 (this is additional work, if stored fields are not needed, but neglectible). Once the index is modified, we know about\n\nOnce an index is modified with 3.x or 4.0 we always update the version and write new segment information. For older segments, this code also has to inspect the stored fields file, to detect if segment is pre-3.x. This is done exatctly once during update of segments_N.",

It only does so when it's time to apply deletes, do merges, open an NRT reader, etc.\n\nThis is a serious bug because you can in fact succeed in committing with the new major version of Lucene against your too-old index, which is catastrophic because suddenly the old Lucene version will no longer open the index, and so your index becomes unusable.",
