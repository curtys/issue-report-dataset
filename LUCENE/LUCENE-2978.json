Can u plz check if we can use only one of them under Lucene/Solr?\n\nI've been thinking for some time that we need a module with common libraries used throughout the project. Something w/o code, only jars. I think we have several copies of some jars today, especially Apache ones. Consolidate all of them in one place will be great. We can do this in a separate issue though\u2026",
