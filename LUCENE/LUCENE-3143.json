While, generally, this may include separate norms and deletion files, this SegmentInfo must not reference such files when this method is called, because they are not allowed within a compound file.  Something like that...?",

Today, that method is called from code which ensures that, but we should:\n# Add some documentation to clarify that.\n# Add some asserts so that if a test (or other code, running w/ -ea) does that, we catch it.\n\nWill post a patch soon",
