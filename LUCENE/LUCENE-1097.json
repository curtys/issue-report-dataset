I plan to commit in a day or two.\n\nI changed SegmentMerger to periodically check whether the merge has\nbeen aborted, and changed IndexWriter.close(false) to mark all merges\nas aborted and then wait for them to actually finish.\n\nI changed it so when a merge is aborted it throws an explicit\nexception (MergeAbortedException) which is cleaner than before when\nany number of exceptions could be thrown.\n\nI also added a test case to IndexWriter to test closing a writer w/\ndoWait=false while another thread is still adding documents, which\nuncovered a deadlock case, that I also fixed.\n",

            "body": "Mike,\n\ncool patch! It looks like you added the abort check to all the\ndifferent spots in SegmentMerger and CFSWriter where most of \nthe merge time is spent: mergeFields, mergeTerms, mergeNorms,\nand mergeVectors. So an abort should never take long, no \nmatter which part of the merge is being done when \nIndexWriter.close(false) is called. Good!\n\nI'm wondering how you came up with the values you pass in \ncheckAbort.work()? And does this abort checking have a \nperformance impact?\n\nIn the future when we add more files (e. g. for column \nfields) we have to remember to add corresponding abort checks \nto new code that we add to SegmentMerger. I think it would be \ngood if you added some comments to SegmentMerger.merge() that\nreminds us and gives some hints how to determine the values \nfor checkAbort.work().\n\nThe abort logic should work with all merge policies, right?\nNot only with background merges?\n\nI think this patch finally makes LUCENE-887 obsolete. I'll \nclose it. ",

And does this abort checking have a\nperformance impact?\n{quote}\n\nI did this empirically by increasing the value to .work() until the\nmsec delay in successive calls was not larger than ~ 3 seconds or so,\nwhen building the Wikipedia index with full length docs.  Most of the\ntime it's ~50-100 msec between checks.\n\nI wanted to keep the number of calls to the synchronized\nmerge.isAborted() method to a minimum so we don't impact performance.\nI haven't yet tested it, but I think the performance impact will be in\nthe noise...I'll test to be sure.\n\n{quote}\nIn the future when we add more files (e. g. for column\nfields) we have to remember to add corresponding abort checks\nto new code that we add to SegmentMerger.

(Aborting shouldn't affect the merge\npolicy, which just selects the merges to be done but doesn't run\nthem).  But, yes, this will work w/ all merge schedulers.  The new\nunit test (in TestIndexWriter) specifically tests SerialMergeScheduler\n(in addition to ConcurrentMergeScheduler).\n",

    "description": "Right now when you close(false), IndexWriter marks any running merges\nas aborted but then does not wait for these merges to finish.  This\ncan cause problems because those threads still hold files open, so,\nsomeone might think they can call close(false) and then (say) delete\nall files from that directory, which would fail on Windows.\n\nInstead, close(false) should notify each running merge that it has\nbeen aborted, and not return until all running merges are done.  Then,\nSegmentMerger should periodically check whether it has been aborted\nand stop if so.\n",
