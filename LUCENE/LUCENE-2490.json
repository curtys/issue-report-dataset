Maven can deal with -dev as a version suffix, can't it?\n\nI ask because I'm looking at adding functionality in Lucene and Solr to install Maven jars in the user's local repository, and I was planning on going the route of making everything -dev.\n\nI'll add a link here after I make an issue and put up a patch.\n\n",
