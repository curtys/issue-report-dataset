Implementation of hashCode() and equals() uses the Java List implementation  as a base so to achieve what looks like the original intent of the comparisons, just taking into account the Term[].\n\nAgain, sorry it's not in the correct format. Hope it helps.",

But the underlying class library is from the java distribution, the compiler comes from (Java5's rt.jar), which contains Arrays.hashCode(). The compiler cannot know, that Arrays.hashCode is not available in 1.4 unless it uses an old rt.jar. If you want to be sure to compile 1.4 only, you have to install Java 1.4.",

    "description": "I found this while hunting for the cause of Solr Cache misses.\n\nThe MultiPhraseQuery class hashCode() implementation is non-deterministic. It uses termArrays.hashCode() in the computation. The contents of that ArrayList are actually arrays themselves, which return there reference ID as a hashCode instead of returning a hashCode which is based on the contents of the array. I would suggest an implementation involving the Arrays.hashCode() method.\n\nI will try to submit a patch soon, off for today.",
