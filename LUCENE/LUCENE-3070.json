Currently on flush we pull a FieldsConsumer for every codec used in the indexing session (per DWPT) regardless if this field is indexed. so we are creating some unneeded files if you use one field for docvalues only. The other thing is that we need to somehow reset the FieldInfo#hasDocValues \"flag\" on an error when we are hitting non-aborting exceptions during indexing before we can actually create the corresponding consumer. That is something we should address in a spin-off issue I think.\n\noverall I think you should commit the current state and we work from here!\n",
