I wasn't involved in that discussion, but if I was, I would have argued that calling it IndexDocValues didn't help the situation much and we should have just kept it as DocValues anyway. I just don't think because a class moves to another lucene 'component' that it helps the situation any. I still consider modules first class.\n\nI'd also have argued that in 4 we should rename the function DocValues class to something else.

Its renamed to PerDocProducer (consistent with PerDocConsumer).\n\nIndexReader only has DocValues docValues(String field) as its api. MultiPerDocValues is removed as its not exposed and there is only MultiDocValues. \n\nSortedSource doesn't require that you exposed a packed-ints reader, you might not implement things that way. Instead it has a hasPacked* method so that sorting can optimize in case you do have it.\n\nFieldInfo no longer has a transactional API for setting term vectors or docvalues information: the problem was that we could end out with extra files if there was an exception and only that document needed them. Instead of a commit/revert thing it just sets them after it successfully indexes.\n\nType promotion is moved from the codec implementation to SegmentMerger. Because of this, SegmentMerger no longer lies to other codec components about the fieldinfos, with DocValues changing them behind the scenes, instead it computes fieldinfos up front, writes them to disk, and codecs see \"the real fieldinfos\". This also means like merging of other lucene type information, our 'type promotion' across incompatible docvalues types is well-defined instead of being implementation-dependent.\n\nSome unused/unnecessary/dead methods/code in the abstract apis are removed. \n\nCheckIndex has lots more checking for docvalues (and norms too).\n\n",
