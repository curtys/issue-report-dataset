            "body": "as an explanation, this causes this query to call sumOfSquaredWeights + queryNorm + normalize() twice.\n\nthe reason it doesnt cause any tests to fail in trunk is this:\nin trunk sumOfSquaredWeights is not really a getter, its also a setter:\n{noformat}\n    @Override\n    public float sumOfSquaredWeights() {\n      queryWeight = idf * getBoost();             // compute query weight\n      return queryWeight * queryWeight;           // square it\n    }\n{noformat}\n\nin my patch on LUCENE-3174, my sumOfSquaredWeights returns queryWeight * queryWeight, but doesn't reset any state.\nso you end out normalizing twice and thats why the test failed on the branch.\n",

I fixed it in Constant*, not sure why I left CustomScoreQuery unchanged. Maybe because tests passed.",
