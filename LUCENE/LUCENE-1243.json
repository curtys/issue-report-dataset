At the time I needed to test non String data and there was none.\n\nSo ... please ignore that change. Perhaps the best way is a new DocMaker for good sort data?",

Might want some expansion, but here are some basic ones I have been using:\n\nCommitIndexTask\nReopenReaderTask\nSearchWithSortTask\n\nI do the sort in a similar way that the highlighting was done, but another method may be better. Just would be great to have sorting.\nAlso, since there is no great field for sorting (reuters date always appears to be the same) I changed the id field from doc+id to just id. Again maybe not the best solution, but here I am to get the ball rolling :)",
