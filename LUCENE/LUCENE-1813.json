            "body": "Very very minor thing, but does it make more sense to choose a more suitable character? U+0001 is an assigned character, with some semantic meaning (\"Start of Heading\", same as ASCII character 0x01) which isn't really relevant to this use. It mightn't be a bad idea to (a) choose a control character which makes sense in context, if there is one (I can't see one, myself), (b) using a character from the private-use area (U+E000 to U+F8FF) or (c) my preferred option, using the Unicode tag characters. The tag characters are designed for just such a purpose.. embedding contextual metadata in text fields. The general syntax for a tag is <TAG TYPE> followed by one or more <TAG CHARACTER>s. Unfortunately, only one tag type is defined in unicode at present (language tag), which isn't suitable.\n\nThat said, I think it makes sense (and is probably 'nicer') to pick one of the Unicode tag characters -- say, U+E0052 TAG LATIN CAPITAL LETTER R (for 'reverse') and use that. This could lead to a de facto standard for Lucene fields, where different variations of the same token could use different leading tag characters. Rather than just everyone picking a character at random, this could lead to some sort of structure around similar situations (i.e. I could envisage a filter which uses U+E004E TAG LATIN CAPITAL LETTER N for a normalised version of the token, etc). \n\nSorry, I'm really anal about Unicode. Can't help it.",

U+ECxx, maybe, because that's got 3 letters out of 'lucene' in it :) . So EC00 means 'reversed', and then people who need other similar filters can organise amongst themselves.",

I'm taking an interest in this purely because I have some ideas for other token filters which would do something similar, and really like the idea of tagging them in the same way just with different 'headers'. It would be really beneficial, I think, to come up with something that can be reused and, more importantly, combined (so different filters don't 'clash' with their output). What about making it 2 characters, at least? \n\nU+0001 START OF HEADER\nU+xxxx whatever you like to indicate 'reversing' (i.e. an 'R', or just a 0-byte as this is the first purpose allocated, or whatever)\n\nThis adds 2 bytes to each term, not 1, but terms generally don't take up that much room in the scale of a whole index and I think it's worth the flexibility. Hell, if you're willing to use 3 (that IS starting to seem wasteful, I admit) then maybe\n\nU+0001 START OF HEADER\nU+xxxx whatever\nU+0002 START OF TEXT\n\nThat's at least semantically meaningful. Other ideas, just looking at the ASCII control characters:\n\nU+xxxx whatever\nU+001F UNIT SEPARATOR\n\nor\n\nU+000E SHIFT OUT\nU+xxxx whatever\nU+000F SHIFT IN\n\nI don't really mind, but it's always nice to plan ahead.",

The use case for this filter means that it will create more or less as many tokens as there were in the original token stream, thus doubling the size of term dictionary. One byte here, one byte there, and suddenly it matters whether we use 0001 or FFFF ...",

I think 0001 is just fine, even if not from a purity perspective.\n\nSome of my texts have BIDI markers and while these will be stripped by filters, I don't think this use is analogous.\n\n",
