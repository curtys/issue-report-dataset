    "description": "I've been stress testing DocumentsWriter by indexing wikipedia, but not\ngiving enough memory to the JVM, in varying heap sizes to tickle the\ndifferent interesting cases.  Sometimes DocumentsWriter can deadlock;\nother times it will hit a subsequent NPE or AIOOBE or assertion\nfailure.\n\nI've fixed all the cases I've found, and added some more asserts.  Now\nit just produces plain OOM exceptions.  All changes are contained to\nDocumentsWriter.java.\n\nAll tests pass.  I plan to commit in a day or two!",
