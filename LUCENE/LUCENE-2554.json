The new random test (TestSurrogates) is good at finding bugs there...\n\nThe hack I have to forcefully use the test-only preflexrw codec needs to be made more generic, so that we can randomly pick the default codec to use for each test.",

We still need a clean way to randomly swap in the preflexrw codec....\n\nI don't think we should do this with RandomIndexWriter like we do now, but pull this stuff out of there and move it to ant/LuceneTestCase.\n\nI would prefer if we could supply a variable to ant (e.g. -Dtest.codec=) and LuceneTestCase[J4] would set the codec to this.\nWe could allow for a value of \"random\" here also to do what RIW does today.\nI think this would make it easier to run the entire test suite with different codecs.\n\nAlso, some tests testCases might not be suitable for all codecs, and so we need to add annotations or some way to special-case these tests.\n",

    "description": "The surrogate dance in the preflex codec (which must dynamically remap terms from UTF16 order to unicode code point order) is buggy.\n\nTo better test it, I want to add a test-only codec, preflexrw, that is able to write indices in the pre-flex format.  Then we should also fix tests to randomly pick codecs (including preflexrw) so we better test all of our codecs.",
