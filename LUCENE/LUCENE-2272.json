Something like:\n{code}\npublic Explanation explain(int docId){\n    Explanation result = new Explanation();\n    result.setDescription(\"Unimpl Payload Function Explain\");\n    result.setValue(1);\n    return result;\n  };\n{code}\nshould do the trick\n* The changes don't seem thread safe any more since there are now member variables.  It may still be all right, but have you looked at this aspect?",

This is included in the patch\n\n>The changes don't seem thread safe any more since there are now member variables. It may still be all right, but have you looked at this aspect?\n\nI guess that could be said about PayloadTermSpanScorer and PayloadNearSpanScorer, too (payloadScore, payloadsSeen). As for the PayloadFunction classes, they seem lightweight enough to be created with each query. Is there a better pattern?\n\nPeter\n\n\n",

I have regenerated the patch against the trunk, which also restored the generics and missing annotations.
