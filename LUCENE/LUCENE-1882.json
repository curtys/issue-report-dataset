I am curious if you have trouble with this patch to package.html now that you have corrected the EOL issue?\n\nit might have just been the content type in the html header ... but i don't think so, i think it had to do with the line endings of the patch, vs the updated line endencins once i fixed the eol-style ... plus i was trying a bunch of differnt things to fix hte line endings ... i don't know what it was exactly, but this new patch seems to work fine (evne with the non ascii glyphs) so i think we're good.",
