In IW.ReaderPool.SegmentCacheKey the equals() method - Does it need to call .equals on the SegmetnInfo and context? Since we are just including IOContext.Context only won't this be wrong ?\n\nYes, it should && the .equals of its two member.  It's not wrong -- we only must ensure that the SegmentReader for merging is shared during merging, and for searching during searching; we don't want t open a new SegmentReader for every new IOContext.\n\nActually: why do we have IOContext.equals/hashCode...?  Who relies on these methods today?\n\nReaderPool.commit should pass IOContext.READ.\n\nI think we should add a ReaderPool.getIfExists that does not take an IOContext and tries both READ and MERGE and returns the SegmentReader if it's found; likewise for release.",

Maybe it would make more sense to pass in the context here too OR don't put the IOContext in the cache key and hold two distinct maps one for read one for merge? The try catch here doesn't make sense to me at all.",

I think it's ready to commit.\n\nThis was trickier than I thought, because we had to take care to\nensure the deletions are applied only against readers pulled in a READ\ncontext, and then pull the latest deletions from the READ context when\nmerging.  So I started with Varun's patch and iterated from there...\n\nAlso, there was a great simplification that fell out of this: we no\nlonger need that scary SR.loadTermsIndex method to load a terms index\nafter SR had already been created.  We only needed this for the case\nwhere an SR opened for merging was then shared with an NRT reader, but\nthis is no longer possible.\n",
