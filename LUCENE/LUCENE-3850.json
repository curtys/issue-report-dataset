Previous versions did not complain about that (e.g. compiling 1.5 code with 1.6). This warning simply says, that you should have a different bootstrap classpath with only the 1.6 JDK rt.jar in it, so the compiler can check that the methods/classes you are using are really existing. If you compoile against Java 7's rt.jar this is not guaranteed.\n\nThe warning is obsolete for us, as we also check java 6 and java 5 (for 3.x).",

    "description": "Java 7 changed the warnings a little bit:\n- Java 6 only knew \"unchecked\" warning type, applying for all types of generics violations, like missing generics (raw types)\n- Java 7 still knows \"unchecked\" but only emits warning if the call is really unchecked. Declaration of variables/fields or constructing instances without type param now emits \"rawtypes\" warning.\n\nThe changes above causes the Java 7 compile now emit lots of \"rawtypes\" warnings, where Java 6 is silent. The easy fix is to suppres both warning types: @SuppressWarnings({\"unchecked\",\"rawtypes\"}) for all those places. Changes are easy to do, will provide patch later!",
