    "description": "Using a ConstantScoreQuery through a MultiSearcher on a Searchable obtained through RMI (RemoteSearchable) will throw a java.io.NotSerializableException\n\nThe problem seems to be the fact that the ConstantScoreQuery.ConstantWeight has a Searcher member variable which is not serializable. Keeping a reference to the Searcher does not seem to be required: the fix seems trivial.\n\nI've created the TestCase to reproduce the issue and the patch to fix it.",
