I don't think it even compiles yet. \n\nIdea:  Add dev-tools/validation and hook in code into it that does work to validate our systems for things like licenses, etc.  It will then be hooked in at compile time for both Lucene and Solr.\n\nIn this particular case, it will look for license files for each jar file and fail if one is missing.  This requires there to be, for every JAR file, a file with the same name and the name of the license.txt appended to it, as in foo.jar.BSD.txt or something like that (still being worked out)",

The checker classes should be build through compile-tools task (without clover) and then used.\n\nIn my opinion, this license-checker main() should be in /lucene/dev/src/tools not /lucene/dev/src/test-framework. We already have this folder to e.g. rebuild the files of StandardTokenizer and so on.\n\nAlso executing this in clover would create code coverage which is not really runtime-created.\n\nA quick fix would be to disable the license checker if run.clover=1, but I don't like it how it is now.",
