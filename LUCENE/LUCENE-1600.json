A moderate usage of String.intern() is fine i think, my patch just takes it out of the hot-path (for my use-case at least). Other uses of String.intern() in the codebase may have different solutions/tradeoffs certainly.",

    "description": "I profiled a simple MatchAllDocsQuery() against ~1.5 million documents (8 fields of short text, Field.Store.YES,Field.Index.NOT_ANALYZED_NO_NORMS), then retrieved all documents via searcher.doc(i, fs). String.intern() showed up as a top hotspot (see attached screenshot), so i implemented a small optimization to not intern() for every new Field(), instead forcing the intern in the FieldInfos class and adding a optional \"internName\" constructor to Field. This reduced execution time for searching and iterating through all documents by 35%. Results were similar for -server and -client.\n\n\nTRUNK (2.9) w/out patch: matched 1435563 in 8884 ms/search\nTRUNK (2.9) w/patch: matched 1435563 in 5786 ms/search",
