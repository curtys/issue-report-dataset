            "body": "On or around April 9th, I changed the build to use the \"old\" nightly.sh script (but slightly modified).  The main modification was that I commented out the copy of the docs and tar files to the release server (since Hudson takes care of publishing these now).  Unforunately, this meant that the subsequent clover build further down in the script over-wrote the tar files with clover references, which Hudson then archives once the script completes.\n\nI've rearranged the script to run clover first then the regular build.  I've run a new build and it seems to be fixed.",
