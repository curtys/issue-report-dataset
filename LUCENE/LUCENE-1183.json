            "body": "It occurs to me that we apparently have two different implementations of Levenshtein, one in spellchecker and one for FuzzyQuery.  I haven't analyzed them individually to know for sure, but if this is a much better implementation, then we should think about using it for FuzzyQuery, too.  \n\nThe FuzzyQuery (FuzzyTermEnum) version claims to have a fast-fail mechanism, too:\n{quote}\n<p>Embedded within this algorithm is a fail-fast Levenshtein distance\n   * algorithm.  The fail-fast algorithm differs from the standard Levenshtein\n   * distance algorithm in that it is aborted if it is discovered that the\n   * mimimum distance between the words is greater than some threshold.\n   *\n   * <p>\n{quote}\n\nCedrik, since you seem to know about these things, would you have time to look at FuzzyTermEnum?  A 3x speedup there would be great for users, too.",
