I\ncutover to simple ctors (3 of them, depending on how the core/del docs\nare set) instead of static get methods.\n\nI removed clone() from all IR impls and made final IR.clone() that throws\nUOE.  Cloning no longer makes sense since all IRs are read-only...\n\nI pushed all \"pending deletes\" tracking inside IW, and changed the\nreaderPool to store a map of SegmentInfo to the \"state\" that IW needs\nto track for each segment (open reader for searching, open reader for\nmerging, live docs and pending delete count).\n\nI think it's ready...\n",

So LUCENE-3653 is a non-issue, when this is committed. Same applies to IR/DR/... - almost all synchronized methods can go away. And decRef, too, as it's already guarded by AtomicRef\n\nAnd in my opinion incRef/decRef on IndexReaders is useless, too (or almost useless, except segmentreaders). As Shai said before, code like SearcherManager should reCount externaly with a separate interface/helperclass (that refcounts and on decRef to 0, it calls Closeable.close - so helper can work on any Closeable). But we should remove that in separate issue.",

So I think  we may use some conbination of approach for the LUCENE-3837 and a current segment system where any updates after commit go to the a new file like we do with segments. And when the docValues will be read to a memory we will fetch all files and values in a file with higher generation will override values with same docIds.\nOf course it increases even more the total amount of files.

It would be good, if SegmentReader itsself could be read-only like all other IndexReaders.\n\nThere are two possibilities to do this:\n# the simple one: Subclass SegmentReader and make a RWSegmentReader that is only used by IndexWriter/BufferedDeletes/... DirectoryReader will only use the read-only SegmentReader. This would move all TODOs to a separate class. It's reopen/clone method would always create a RO-SegmentReader (for NRT).\n# Remove all write and commit stuff from SegmentReader completely and move it to IndexWriter's readerPool (it must be in readerPool as deletions need a not-changing view on an index snapshot).\n\nUnfortunately the code is so complicated and I have no real experience in those internals of IndexWriter so I did not want to do it with LUCENE-3606, I just separated the code in SegmentReader and marked with TODO.
