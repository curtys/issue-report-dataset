    "description": "A few of the Lucene source files call System.getProperty and perform a couple of\nother operations within static initializers that assume full Java 2 permissions.\nThis prevents Lucene from being used from an unsigned applet embedded in a\nbrowser page, since the default security permissions for an applet will prohibit\nreading of most properties.\n\nI would suggest wrapping the initialization of the properties in try/catch\nblocks. This does mean that a couple properties would need to be made non-final,\nand in some cases, getter and setter methods might be desirable to allow the\napplet programmer to change the property values at runtime (some variables are\npublic static and could be changed directly without accessors).\n\nThis problem occurs with the shipping 1.4.3 version as well as the latest (as of\n 07-apr-2005) source code fetched from CVS.\n\nCurrently, the files that are affected are org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter,\norg.apache.lucene.index.SegmentReader, org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery,\nand org.apache.lucene.store.FSDirectory.\n\nI have modified versions of these files with some suggested changes, plus a\nsimple test applet and associated files that demonstrate the situation. The\nsample applet can be launched in a browser either by double-clicking the file\nlocally or by putting it on a web server and launching it from an http URL. As\nsoon as I can figure out how to attach to a bug report, I'll do that.\n\nP.S. This topic came up in August, 2004 in lucene dev mailing list but as far as\nI can tell, has not yet been resolved.",
