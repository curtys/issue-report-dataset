    "description": "I started working on this in LUCENE-2658, here is the finished patch.\n\nThere are some problems with LuceneTestCase:\n* a tests beforeClass, or the test itself (its @befores and its method), might have some\n  random behavior, but only the latter can be reproduced with -Dtests.seed\n* if you want to do things in beforeClass, you have to use a different API: newDirectory(random)\n  instead of newDirectory, etc.\n* for a new user, the current output can be verbose, confusing and overwhelming.\n\nSo, I refactored this class to address these problems. \nA class still needs 2 seeds internally, as the beforeClass will only run once, \nbut the methods or setUp() might run many times, especially when increasing iterations.\n\nbut lucenetestcase deals with this, and the \"seed\" is 128-bit (UUID): \nthe MSB is initialized in beforeClass, the LSB varied for each method run.\nif you provide a seed with a -D, they are both fixed to the UUID you provided.\n\nI fixed the API to be consistent, so you should be able to migrate a test from \nsetUp() to beforeClass() [junit3 to junit4] without changing parameters.\n\nThe codec, locale, timezone is only printed once at the end if any tests fail, \nas its per-class anyway (setup in beforeClass)\n\nfinally, when a test fails, you get a single \"reproduce with\" command line you can copy and paste to reproduce.\nthis way you dont have to spend time trying to figure out what the command line should be.\n\n{noformat}\n    [junit] Tests run: 2, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Time elapsed: 0.197 sec\n    [junit]\n    [junit] ------------- Standard Output ---------------\n    [junit] NOTE: reproduce with: ant test -Dtestcase=TestExample -Dtestmethod=testMethodA \n              -Dtests.seed=a51e707b-6550-7800-9f8c-72622d14bf5f\n    [junit] NOTE: reproduce with: ant test -Dtestcase=TestExample -Dtestmethod=testMethodB \n              -Dtests.seed=a51e707b-6550-7800-f7eb-2efca3820738\n    [junit] NOTE: test params are: codec=PreFlex, locale=ar_LY, timezone=Etc/UCT\n    [junit] ------------- ---------------- ---------------\n    [junit] Test org.apache.lucene.util.TestExample FAILED\n{noformat}\n",
