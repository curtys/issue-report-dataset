If you try 2007.org -- this is a correct domain name (and has a funny website on it :), so, given the fact that we don't check for typical suffixes, such as \".com\", <HOST> doesn't seem wrong. On the other hand, 2004.jpg may well have been some sort of numerical code or a product number, so <NUM> is not totally irrelevant either.\n\nFor the JFlex-based tokenizer, I put the <NUM> rule matching first, as it gives some nice performance benefits. We can put HOST first, and then we'll get compliance with the old version.\n\nAnother option we might consider is:\n\n* adding a new token type for file names (get a list of common extensions or even assume that an extension is simply three alphanumerical characters) \n* checking for common domain names in hosts (something along the lines of: \"mil\" | \"info\" | \"gov\" | \"edu\" | \"biz\" | \"com\" | \"org\" | \"net\" |  \"arpa\" | {LETTER}{2})\n\nI'm not sure how this will affect the performance of the tokenizer, but my rough guess is that if we don't come up with very complex/ backtracking-prone rules there should not be too much of a difference. On the other hand, if 100% compatibility with the old tokenizer is a priority, adding new token types is not a good idea, I guess.\n\nFinally, when it comes to the initialization time of the new tokenizer -- according to the JFlex documentation, some time is required to unpack the transition tables. But the unpacking takes place during the initialization of static fields, so once the class is loaded the overhead should be negligible.",

I guess the biggest problem here is that the scanner generated by JavaCC doesn't seem to strictly follow the specification (see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-966#action_12516893), so I'd need to emulate possible JavaCC \"bugs\" I'm not aware of at the moment (I'm not an expert on lexical scanner generation either, not yet at least :). I can add some workarounds to the grammar to make the known incompatibility examples work, but this won't guarantee consistency in general.\n\nAs a side note, it's a shame there's no trace of the version of JavaCC that was used to generate the scanner for the original StandardAnalyzer. I'm also curious if the results of the current JavaCC grammar would be the same with the newest version of the generator (4.0 I guess) -- I'll try to check that.\n\nAnyway, I'll take a look at the problem in more depth once again. And in the worst case scenario, we can keep the StandardAnalyzer as it was and add the new one next to it so that people can have a choice (on the other hand, this might be a problem for the quality tests).",

If we want to be compatible with the StandardAnalyzer, we should forget about that patch.\n\nMark -- have you tried the jflex-analyzer-r560135-patch.txt patch with your wikipedia diff test?
