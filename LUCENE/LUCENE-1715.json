In some environments you don't have a choice (mobile phones for instance) and if selected pieces of \"nulling\" code can speed things up we should do it. I will run a benchmark on a dalivk VM (Android) to show the difference with the change. I might not have time today or tomorrow though. \nThis change is not visible to anybody using lucene so to me its not that much of a deal. \nTo be honest I'm not a fan of doing that at all but in this case it \"could\" be useful in some corner cases but does not harm anybody.",
