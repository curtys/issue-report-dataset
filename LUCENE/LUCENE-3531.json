If you want a complete WeakIdentityHashMap witha all iterators and so on its heavy to do and you must in all cases also wrap all keys with a WeakReference even for lookup (unless you implement your completely own HashMap impl). The easy fix here is to use a wrapper \"Reference\" object as cache key, that simply has a final field and equals/hashCode that does the system hashcode. By comparing the wrapper object as key, two wrapper objects are only equal, if the wrapped objects are identical:\n\n{code:java}\nstatic final class IdentityKeyWrapper<T> {\n  public final T key;\n  private final int hashCode;\n\n  public IdentityKeyWrapper(T key) {\n    this.key = key;\n    this.hashCode = System.identityHashCode(key);\n  }\n\n  public int hashCode() { return hashCode; }\n\n  public boolean equals(Object o) {\n   if (o == this) return true;\n   if (o instanceof IdentityKeyWrapper) {\n     return ((IdentityKeyWrapper<T>)o).key == this.key;\n   }\n   return false;\n  }\n\n}\n{code}\n\nThe backside is that you have to wrap the Bits interface even on a lookup, but thats cheap just like boxing/unboxing (eden space).",

We came  to the conclusion, that using the acceptDocs (may be null) as a sub-key are suboptimal, because the null key cannot be evicted from the WeakIdentityHashMap. Also the two caches inside each other are hard to manage.\n\nThe idea was to have a \"combined\" key on segmentreader, thats hard referenced by the instance, changing only when deletions change. This key should also only have identity equals/hashCode.\n\nIndexReader like in 3.x now supplies two keys, one based on the core without deletions, and a second one thats equal for all segmentreaders with same deletions and same core. The trick is to use a Object field in SegmentReader thats initialized with new Object() at the beginning and transferred over to a new instance when cloned. But once deletions change, we reassign a new \"new Object()\", so the key changes.\n\nCachingWrapperFilter uses either the conventional coreCacheKey (if if does not respect deletions at all and caches without acceptDocs), or it uses the combined key (IndexReader.getCombinedCoreAndDeletesKey()) for the cache.\n\nThe WeakIdentityHashMap is therefore obsolete again, I will nuke it.",
