So these configurations are now also randomly picked when running tests (= spikes on the monster's back).",

Nevertheless, would that deprecate all parameters? When I want to use randomized tests but need to force a certain codec that wouldn't work. Anyway, a documentation of whatever we do here would help people new to lucene to get started with patches and test.",

When I want to use randomized tests but need to force a certain codec that wouldn't work.\n\nYes it would, as random codec selection would be determined by the same random seed (so if you use the same seed, you force the same codec).\n\nbq. Anyway, a documentation of whatever we do here would help people new to lucene to get started with patches and test.\n\nI dont think we should add a lot of documentation (which will only become obselete as i know i will be adding even more dimensions to the test ASAP). I think its better to simplify and use a single seed for selecting all parameters! ",
