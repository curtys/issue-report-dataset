Maybe it is a good idea to summarize the actual problems/challenges/benefits in a few sentences?\n\nWhat I understand is that you plan to add arbitrary (cacheable) attributes to IndexReader. I suggest to move these features to the IndexCache proposed in LUCENE-2133. Especially when using decorating IndexReaders (things like \"ReadOnlyIndexReader\") you would not want to store attributes separately from the decorated IndexReader. The same probably applies to SegmentReader with all its clones.\n\nIndexCache would provide a common base for the extensions you mentioned. (i.e. you are welcome to apply your patches on top of LUCENE-2133).",

Could we perhaps merge the two issues (LUCENE-2133 and LUCENE-2135)?\n\nA quick summary of LUCENE-2133:\n\nThe patch allows one or more IndexReaders to share common cache information (whatever this is), stored in the same \"IndexCache\" instance. The IndexCache is designed to contain *any* cacheable/volatile information that can be regenerated from the IndexReader.\n\nFor example: all clones of SegmentReader share the same SegmentReaderIndexCache with the original instance, containing the ThreadLocals of the \"core reader\".\nBy default (for all IndexReader classes) the IndexCache provides access to the \"IndexFieldCache\" (a non-static reimplementation of FieldCache).\n\n\nTo provide arbitrary cacheable objects we could now extend IndexCache by a simple HashMap (it does not need to be a WeakHashMap, since the IndexCache is closed and purged as soon as the original IndexReader is closed).\n\nIf you wish so, with the help of IndexCache we might even easily implement two different field caches for the same IndexCache instance, one that changes with deleted docs and another one that does not. Basically we may add any other kind of cache at a later point *without* touching IndexReader again. To re-use Earwin Burrfoot statement from above, that would then *not* \"complicate IndexReader beyond that unholy mess it already is.\" ",

But this lacks immediacy on releasing the reference, after a reader is closed.\n\nWeakHashMap can't free the key until the reader is no longer referenced by the app. And, apparently, WeakHashMap has a further impl detail that requires invoking one of its methods for it to notice that a key has just become only weakly reachable.\n\nTo fix this, I think on IR.close we should evict entries from the FieldCache, as long as the sub-readers are truly closed (refCount dropped to 0).",
