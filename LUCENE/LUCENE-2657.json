Does it have some magic way to know this?\n\nAs an example, lets take modules/analysis/icu which has 3 dependencies:\n* Lucene core itself (implicit from contrib-build.xml)\n* external dependency: ICU\n* internal dependency: modules/analysis/common\n\ntake a look at modules/analysis/icu's pom.xml which has:\n{noformat}\n  <dependencies>\n    <dependency>\n      <groupId>com.ibm.icu</groupId>\n      <artifactId>icu4j</artifactId>\n      <version>${icu-version}</version>\n    </dependency>\n  </dependencies>\n{noformat}\n\nHowever, our ant builds (that depend on common-build/contrib-build) declare their dependencies in a semi-standard way:\n* External dependencies:\n{noformat}\n<path id=\"additional.dependencies\">\n  <fileset dir=\"lib\" includes=\"icu4j-*.jar\"/>\n</path>\n{noformat}\n* Internal dependencies:\n{noformat}\n<module-uptodate name=\"analysis/common\" \njarfile=\"../build/common/lucene-analyzers-common-${version}.jar\"\n  property=\"analyzers-common.uptodate\" classpath.property=\"analyzers-common.jar\"/>\n{noformat}\n\nThe contrib-build.xml already has a 'dist-maven' target, that is called recursively. Perhaps an alternative would be to improve contrib-build.xml for it to have a 'generate-maven' target, also called recursively.\nI've already prototyped/proposed in SOLR-2002 that we migrate the solr build to extend the lucene build, so everywhere would use it.\n\nFurthermore, couldnt we also make a recursive 'test-maven' target, that generates a maven project to 'download' or whatever it needs, then tries to run all the tests?\nIf somehow the maven is broken, the tests simply won't pass.\n\nI realize that running all of a modules tests again redundantly via 'maven' might not be the most elegant solution, but it seems like it would test that everything is working.\n",

While they are templates I can at least see them and they can be validated by XML validators (including IDEs).  Suddenly they are created through a more complex process which we also have to maintain.  \n\nAssuming we have well-structured poms in the first place (huge assumption, different issue), are developers unprepared to add the appropriate dependency to the necessary pom? It doesn't seem like it'll happen very often, most of our artifacts have very few dependencies and we resist increasing them.  We can document the process, make it very clear exactly what needs to be added and where.\n\nAlso, I'm not sure all jars are going to have the appropriate manifest.  If the pom is generated (like Artifactory can do btw), I'm not sure it is packaged in the jar?\n\nI think Robert was onto the right idea with this original proposal: If we consider our modules section and if we add a pom at the modules level and then one for each module, running a build from the modules level will recursively build each module.  If there is something wrong with the poms themselves, maven will fail.  If a dependency is omitted meaning the code cannot be built, maven will fail.  If any of these 2 issues occur, then the build would fail and an issue can be created for those more comfortable with maven to fix.",

Some even have the wrong information in the manifest...\n\nI think we can use .jar digest (SHA-1) as identifiers to look up the appropriate Maven info to automatically set up POM dependencies.  I wrote a script to crawl the central Maven repo for SHA-1 keyed Maven coordinates (groupId:artifactId:version), and it seems to work, but at the rate it's progressing, it will take 4 days to finish.  Anyway, it seems like overkill to gather info on all of the ~250k artifacts in the Maven central repo, just to handle the ~80 .jar files in the Lucene/Solr source tree.  \n\nI found a free service that provides Maven central repo search, including by artifact digest: http://www.jarvana.com/jarvana/search - it uses Lucene to power the search :).

Some people understand how it works, but I've certainly seen users who are dabbling in some development and are confused by our maven support.  I cant think of another project that generates its poms (even ant itself has the poms well-formed inside its codebase) so suddenly our support has become more unusual.\n\nWhat I'm hoping is that we can actually add quality support for maven in such a way that users wouldn't be surprised, developers like you and I can get the benefits we know maven has, and that also simplifies what Robert has to do.  \n\nIf all we can do at the moment is bolt bits of maven onto ant, I'm unsure its worth while.",

As a result, the 4 or 5 locations in the Lucene/Solr build that have \"mixed content\" (to borrow the XML term for mixed nested element and text content) have to be fudged; e.g. the Lucene and Solr core POMs are located in {{lucene/src/}} and {{solr/src/}}, because the aggregator POMs at {{lucene/}} and {{solr/}} can't produce binary artifacts.

Maven itself is not invoked in the process. An Ant plugin handles the artifact deployment.\nI will now try to decipher these quotes.\nIt seems the patch takes the artifacts produced by Ant, as a part of our usual (and only) build process, and shoves it down Maven repository's throat along with a bunch of pom-descriptors.\nNothing else is happening.\n\nAlso, after everything that has been said, I think nobody in his right mind will *force* anyone to actually use the Ant target in question as a part of release. But it's nice to have it around, in case some user-friendly commiter would like to push (I'd like to reiterate - ant generated) artifacts into Maven.",

I am pretty sure that we have enough PMC members who want Maven that they can vote on said artifacts w/o those who don't want Maven to have to bother (even though they are the same artifacts).  Also, Robert, I would specifically ask you, once Steve has done the work, assuming you are the RM, to honestly evaluate whether the production of the artifacts is a burden for you.  If you don't want to, then I would suggest you do all the main RM work and you let one of us handle producing the artifacts to be released/voted on at the same time.  If it really is a burden, then we can move it to dev-tools or external.\n\nAnd, for the record, there are more than two camps for Maven besides \"die maven die\" and \"maven or die\":  I personally think distributing artifacts via the central repository and the explicit requirement to list out dependencies and their versions is a great service and significantly increases uptake of artifacts, but I can live just fine without the day to day crap that is the result of running \"mvn XXXX\" (where XXXX is not equal to one of the simpler things like compile or test).   Let's not be confused about what we are doing when we say we are supporting Maven.  We are just using it to publish artifacts.  The only time that should ever need to be run is during a release (hence it doesn't slow down us deciding to do a release, it just slows down, marginally, the actual release process.)  \n\nI totally agree we don't want two build systems and I am totally against switching to Maven as a build for all the reasons Robert is (parallel tests, etc.).  All I have ever wanted is reliable published artifacts and I think we have enough support amongst committers to do that and we have strong enough interest in the community to warrant it.\n\n",
