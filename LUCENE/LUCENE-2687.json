    "description": "These APIs are new in 3.x, so we can do this with no backwards-compatibility issue:\n\nBefore 3.1, FuzzyQuery had its own internal rewrite method.\nWe exposed this in 3.x as TopTermsBooleanQueryRewrite, and then as subclasses for Scoring and Boost-only variants.\n\nThe problem I have is that the PQ has a default (large) size of Integer.MAX_VALUE... of course its later limited by\nthe value of BooleanQuery's maxClauseCount, but I think this is a trap.\n\nInstead its better to simply remove these defaults and force the user to provide a default (reasonable) size.\n",
