In my use cases the range queries are the\nprimary document reduction mechanism so I wouldn't benefit from 'skip to'\nimplementation to avoid reading a lot of field values.",

Any large range throws\nTooManyClauses.  You'll note in an earlier comment that 34673 is a contribution\nthat fixes this case essentially by turning the query into a filter.\n\nMy submission catches the TooManyExceptions exception within the rewrite method\nof RangeQuery then attempts to construct either an IntegerRangeQuery or\nFloatRangeQuery (this permits you to control the mechanism by manipulating the\nmaximum boolean clauses).  Both of these work by:\n1) pulling field values for all docnos (as in the numeric sorting solution)\n2) creating an array of docnos then sorting that array relative to the field values\n3) at query time, the bounds are found using (indirect) binary search on the\ndocnos to find the set of docnos that match the range\n4) the query sorts this set of docnos back into docno order and returns that set\n\nRange sorting is useful for e.g. prices, heights etc. etc.",
