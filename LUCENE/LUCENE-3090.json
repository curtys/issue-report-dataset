I also ensure that incoming threads help out flushing if there are DWPT about to flush but not taken yet before indexing their document. All tests pass (I run them lots of times :)",

Ie, we stall all indexing if the number of flush-pending DWPTs is >= the number of active DWPTs, I think?\nRight so lets say we have two active thread states:\n1. thread 1 starts indexing (max ram is 16M) it indexes n docs and has 15.9 MB ram used. Now n+1 doc comes in has 5MB (active mem= 20.9M flush Mem: 0M)\n\n2. take it out for flush (active mem=0M flush Mem: 20.9M)\n\n3. thread 2 starts indexing and fills ram quickly ending up with 18M memory (active mem=18M flush Mem: 20.9M)\n4. take thread 2 out for flush (active mem=0M flush Mem: 38.9M)\n5. thread 3 has already started indexing and reaches the RAM threshold (16M) so we have: (active mem=16M flush Mem: 38.9M)\n6. take it out for flushing (now we stall currently) (active mem=0M flush Mem: 54.9M) - this is more than 3x max ram buffer.\n\nwe currently stall at  flush-pending DWPTs is > (num active DWPT + 1) we can reduce that though but maybe we should swap back to ram based stalling?\n\n\n",

            "body": "next iteration. This patch changes the stalling mechanism from using num DWPT flushing to netBytes and stalls at 2 x maxRamBuffer if we flush on num bytes. Stalling on memory consumption allows to add an assert / upper bound to the netMemory which is nice but it doesn't help if we are not flushing on RAM usage.\n\nI think what we need to do (sep. issue) is to allow people to add a maxTotalUsedRam which defaults to 2x maxRamBuffer if set or Runtime#maxMemory() / 2 if flushing by docCount to allow us to stall indexing threads iff we cross that border and there is at least one DWPT flushing or pending.

    "description": "We have seen several OOM on TestNRTThreads and all of them are caused by DWFlushControl missing DWPT that are set as flushPending but can't full due to a full flush going on. Yet that means that those DWPT are filling up in the background while they should actually be checked out and blocked until the full flush finishes. Even further we currently stall on the maxNumThreadStates while we should stall on the num of active thread states. I will attach a patch tomorrow.",
