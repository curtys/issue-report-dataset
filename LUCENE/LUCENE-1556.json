    "description": "the EMAIL expression in StandardTokenizerImpl.jflex misses some unusual but valid characters in the left-hand-side of the email address. This causes an address to be broken into several tokens, for example:\n\nsomename+site@gmail.com gets broken into \"somename\" and \"site@gmail.com\"\nhusband&wife@talktalk.net gets broken into \"husband\" and \"wife@talktalk.net\"\n\nThese seem to be occurring more often. The first seems to be because of an anti-spam trick you can use with google (see: http://labnol.blogspot.com/2007/08/gmail-plus-smart-trick-to-find-block.html). I see the second in several domains but a disproportionate amount are from talktalk.net, so I expect it's a signup suggestion from the service.\n\nPerhaps a fix would be to change line 102 of StandardTokenizerImpl.jflex from:\nEMAIL      =  {ALPHANUM} ((\".\"|\"-\"|\"_\") {ALPHANUM})* \"@\" {ALPHANUM} ((\".\"|\"-\") {ALPHANUM})+\n\nto \n\nEMAIL      =  {ALPHANUM} ((\".\"|\"-\"|\"_\"|\"+\"|\"&\") {ALPHANUM})* \"@\" {ALPHANUM} ((\".\"|\"-\") {ALPHANUM})+\n\nI'm aware that the StandardTokenizer is meant to be more of a basic implementation rather than an implementation the full standard, but it is quite useful in places and hopefully this would improve it slightly.",
