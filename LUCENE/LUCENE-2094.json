I like how people have tended to err on the side of waiting for solid consensus myself. Its not a big issue here - but as we move away from that I think it will be. Its something that will spread as new users look at old users when determining how they act.\n\nThe more heavy committing one does, the easier I think it is to just decide stuff and cram it in - personally (and I'm just one voice).  The more you do, I think its also more important to allow brief time periods between saying what you are going to do and doing it (though that should always be done). Its easy to say, well we can just change it, or pull it out - but with lazy consensus and how the community works, I think thats conducive to worse code. Its much easier for someone to debate and have questions than it is to hound changes or code out of trunk. In my mind its better if the bottleneck is on the going in, as it has been, rather then shifting things to fixing whats in. Especially if there is debate in an issue still - whether it belongs there or not - I think there should be warning and consensus before a commit.\n\nI realize thats a bit of a tough sell based on this little issue alone - but its a general feeling I've been having as lucene dev has really been ramping up in recent times. I think its important we stick to being conservative about waiting for consensus - giving others a chance to voice their opinion - no matter how sure you are about your decision.

Like Mark, I'm certainly not saying anything bad was done, but, it's a dangerous precedent that \"consensus reached in private is then acted on in public without corresponding public consensus\".\n\nErring on the side of caution, moving more slowly, when consensus is iffy, is best.  Mark's original idea -- to separately open the question of \"hey let's commit this as it stands now and then debate the Version vs separate boolean separately\" would've been a good approach, I think.\n\nAlso, I think other Apache communities have public chats, where devs/contributors/users can hang out and discuss stuff, and it's well publicized that this is the standard place where things are discussed, anyone can join in, etc.  We could consider taking that step for Lucene?

UnmodifiableCharArraySet was introduces with LUCENE-1688 as far as I recall to replace the static string array (stopwords) in StopAnalyzer. \nDuring the refactoring / improvements in contrib/analyzers we decided to make analyzers and tokenfilters immutable and use chararrayset whereever we can. To prevent provided set from being modified while they are in use in a filter the given set is copied and wrapped in an immutable instance of chararrayset. At the same time (still ongoing) we try to convert every set which is likely to be used in a TokenFilter into a charArraySet.  Wordlistloader is not done yet but on the list, the plan is to change the return values from HashSet<?> into Set<?> and create CharArraySet instances internally. \nWith LUCENE-2034 we introduced StopwordAnalyzerBase which also uses the UnmodifiableCharArraySet with a copy of the given set.\nThe copy of a charArraySet is very fast even for large sets and the creation of a unmodifiableCharArraySet from a CharArraySet instance is basically just an object creation. The background is, again to prevent any modification to those sets while they are in use.\n\nbq.
