It fixes the problem when usePhraseHighlighter=true.\n\nWhen the flag is false and FVH works on N-gram field, not a few terms may be created in tree, then it causes uncontrollable.\n\nBut I think the case of using usePhraseHighlighter=false with N-gram field is rare, the attached patch will be enough.",
