Some failures are expected, because some features aren't implemented yet (e.g. flush by RAM or maxBufferedDeletes).  A test though that I still want to fix with this patch is TestStressIndexing2 - not sure yet what's going on.\n\nOther changes:\n- Factored ReaderPool out of IndexWriter into its own class\n- Added a FilterDirectory that forwards all method calls to a delegate\n- Use an extended FilterDirectory in DW to track all files the consumers and codecs open, so that they can be closed on abort\n- Fixed some more nocommits\n\nUsing the FilterDirectory might not be the cleanest approach?  Maybe a IndexOutputFactory or something would be cleaner?  Or maybe on abort we should just delete all files that have the prefix of the segment(s) the DWPT(s) were working on?  This should be possible now that the shared doc stores are gone and no files are shared anymore across segments.",

The remapDeletes step is still commented out, which results in a wrong behavior as soon as segment merges happen while deletes are buffered.  (I'll use LUCENE-2558 to fix that)",
