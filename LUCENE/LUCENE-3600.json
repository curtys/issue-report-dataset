            "body": "Thanks for fixing the parent with no children!. I think there is still a problem with the assert on a single segment with one parent and child. I just took your test case: testAdvanceSingleParentSingleChild and it fails for me with asserts enabled on the \"assert prevParentDoc >= parentDoc;\" (I copied over the code, having problems with Lucene IDEA project config now...).\n\nImagine there is a single parent and single child. Child is docId 0, and parent is docId 1. A filter for the parent is used in conjunction with the child query. The parent filter is used first, and returns docId 1, which then the BlockJoinQuery advance is called. But, because its the first parent, this call: \"final int prevParentDoc = parentBits.prevSetBit(parentTarget - 1);\" will cause -1 to be returned, which will cause this assert: \"assert prevParentDoc >= parentDoc;\" to fail (parentDoc is 0). Just removing the assert fixes the problem.\n",

The call to parentBits.prevSetBit(parentTarget - 1) will cause -1 to be returned, and the assert will fail, though its valid. Just removing the assert fixes the problem, since nextDoc will handle it properly.\n\nAlso, I don't understand the \"assert parentTarget != 0;\", with a comment of each parent must have one child. There isn't really a reason to add this constraint, as far as I can tell..., just call nextDoc in this case, no?",
