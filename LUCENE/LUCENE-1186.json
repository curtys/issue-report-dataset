For SegmentReader, this is the case when #close() is called. More, as noted in LUCENE-436, some VMs (also recent ones) indeed seem to have problems when ThreadLocal values are not released, so I think it is not just a cosmetic issue.\n",

EG are you picturing a single opaque class instance that'd hold all thread-local like state that Lucene needs to store, which could then be directly controlled by the app (ie, close()'d when the app is done for now interacting with Lucene)?",

The real impl should be configureable via e.g. properties file (keep it simple) to further implement/change to a no-thread-local-at-all-policy if lucene is being used i an thread-pool environment (quartz, web requests,...), or an impl using spring beans, ...
