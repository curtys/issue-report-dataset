            "body": "Pretty much done, all tests pass. It breaks back compat, but frankly, straddling doesn't seem worth the effort here. Or even very possible. You can't really give new methods to use for the deprecated ones, and deprecating by class would be a real nuisance as we would lose class names I'd rather keep. We have no back compat policy, and I think its worth just pushing this to the new API.\n\nI was also thinking about breaking back compat with changing the Highlighter to use the SpanScorer, so doing it all in one shot would be nice. The overall migration should be fairly simple once you understand the new TokenFilter API. I'll handle it for Solr.\n\nStill needs either its own changes file to explain or could go in the contrib common changes file.\n\nThere is a change to the MemoryIndex to get around issues with the new/old API and CachingTokenFilters.\n\nIll have to see how the new TokenFilter API improvements issue works out before doing a final patch for this.",

Because the Highlighter has no back compat promise, I'd almost rather just jump to the new API. I think there are a couple other breaks that should be made (to make using the SpanScorer more rational when we make it the default), so doing everything at once with 2.9 seems somewhat reasonable to me. Updating code to work with the new API should be as straightforward as updating a TokenFilter/TokenStream. I think you could probably continue using the 2.4 Highlighter jar as well? All of the classes should be intact and compatible I think.",

Very bad, all TokenStreams should be final :-) -- *should be* but may not. I think these classes should stay as they are and use Tee/Sink and we should deprecate them. But TeeSinkTokenStream is final (and this is important) and the corresponding Sinks are somehow abstract (without \"known\" implementation).",
