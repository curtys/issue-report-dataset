For example, currently the priority queue in TopTerms does BytesRef -> String conversion and creates a new Term for each add, but this might be entirely useless as it could fall off the pq, so i think its ScoreTerm or whatever should not hold term at all but just bytesref\n\nExactly! We removed support for TermEnum (without s), so field name is never null. You can always take the field from the MTQ when building TermQueries. And for that we create the Term using new Term(field, BytesRef) or with the non-interning placeholder (see also below). This makes MTQ much simplier, I started to do it...\n\nBy the way: we could remove all String interning for field names now? We don't compare fields anymore?",

If we remove string interning from Term, we can replace this by simple new Term() in MTQ.\n\nI delayed cloning of BytesRef until the BytesRef is put into a TermQuery or PQ or whenever it is set aside. But it no longer clones it e.g. if the term is never accepted by the PQ. Also the PQ reuses its ScoreTerm instances and so, the term bytes are simply copied over :-)\n\nI also removed a Java 1.6 interface override - the Generics Policeman gives a ticket!
