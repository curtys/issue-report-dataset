    "description": "ReaderUtil contains two methods that are nowhere used and not even tested. Additionally those are implemented with useless List->array copying; ineffective docStart calculation for a binary search later instead directly returning the reader while scanning -- and I am not sure if they really work as expected. As ReaderUtil is @lucene.internal we should remove them in 3.x and trunk, alternatively the useless array copy / docStarts handling should be removed and tests added:\n\n{code:java}\npublic static IndexReader subReader(int doc, IndexReader reader)\npublic static IndexReader subReader(IndexReader reader, int subIndex)\n{code}\n",
