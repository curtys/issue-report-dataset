For example, it would build an optimized \nPhraseQuery when slop = 0, and there are enough terms to optimize, otherwise it would build a \"normal\" phrasequery.\n\nThen the optimization would be easy to apply, the user just uses NGramPhraseQuery instead of PhraseQuery.\nfor example, from QueryParser:\n{noformat}\n  @Override\n  protected PhraseQuery newPhraseQuery() {\n    return new NGramPhraseQuery();\n  }\n{noformat}\n",

We don't have to commit that patch, but we could separate\nout the queryparser refactoring to make it easier for such an optimization to be \"automatic\" in solr, because it allows\nSolrQueryParser to delegate creation of Phrase/MultiPhraseQuery to the FieldType.\n\n",

A couple more questions:\n* doesn't the optimization also apply to MultiPhraseQuery? If so, NGramPhraseQuery could extend MultiPhraseQuery and just rewrite to the correct one (MultiPhrase or Phrase depending upon the situation after optimization)\n* what about hashCode/equals? Although the same results will be returned, scoring will differ, maybe it NGramPhraseQuery should implement these?\n",
