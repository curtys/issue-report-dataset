We only made them public.\n\nI get your point - you don't think we should commit to this API signature, but IMO we should -- if MS is a valid extension point by applications, we must support this API, otherwise MS cannot be extended at all. Also, getNextMerge() jdoc specifies \"Expert: the MergeScheeduler calls this method ...\" - this kind of makes this API public long time ago, only it wasn't.",

Experimental feels like I'm touching stuff that is not fully ready yet.\n\nBut nm, I'll tag these method as experimental. We can discuss the @expert tag on the list, outside this issue.\n\nI'll commit shortly.",
