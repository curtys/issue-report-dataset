            "body": "A good deal of it Mike and I worked out yesterday on IRC (well, mostly Mike explained and I took copious notes).  The disk storage stuff is based on LIA2.  It is a theoretical model and not an empirical one other than the bytes/term calculation was based off of indexing wikipedia.  \n\nI would deem it a gross approximation of the state of trunk at this point in time.  My gut says the Lucene estimation is a little low, while Solr is fairly close (since I suspect Solr's memory usage is dominated by caching).  I imagine there are things still unaccounted for. For instance, I haven't reverse engineered the fieldValueCache memSize() method yet and I don't have a good sense of how much memory would be consumed in a highly concurrent system by the sheer number of Query objects instantiated or when one has really large Queries (say 5K terms).  It also is not meant to be one size fits all.  Lucene/Solr have a ton of tuning options that could change things significantly.\n\nI did a few sanity checks against things I've seen in the past, and thought it was reasonable.  There is, of course, no substitute for good testing.  In other words, caveat emptor.",

I would clarify the unit of measure (I've seen numerous blogs and emails confuse this).\n\n*Approach to Cache Sizing* - Given memory requirements are heavily contingent on caching I would suggest including at least one approach for how to determine cache size\n\n* Query Result Cache\n** Estimation: should be greater than 'number of commonly reoccurring unique queries' x 'number of sort parameters' x 'number of possible sort orders' \n* Document Cache\n** Estimation: should be greater than 'maximum number of documents per query' x 'maximum number of concurrent queries'\n* Filter Cache\n** Estimation: should be number of unique filter queries (should clarify what constitutes 'unique')\n* Field Value Cache\n** Estimation: should be ?\n* Custom Caches\n** Estimation: should be ? - A common use case?\n\n*Faceting* - Surprised there is no reference to use of faceting which is both increasingly common default query functionality and further increases memory requirements for effective use\n\n*Obscure Metrics* - To really give this spreadsheet some teeth, there really should be pointers for at least one approach on how to estimate each input metric (could be on another tab). \n\n* Some are fairly easy: \n** Number of Unique Terms / field\n** Number of documents\n** Number of indexed fields (no norms)\n** Number of fields w/ norms\n** Number of non-String Sort Fields other than score\n** Number of String Sort Fields\n** Number of deleted docs on avg\n** Avg. number of terms per query\n\n* Some are quite obscure (and guidance on how to estimate is essential):\n** Numberof RAM-based Column Stride Fields (DocValues)\n** ramBufferSizeMB\n** Transient Factor (MB)\n** fieldValueCache Max Size\n** Custom Cache Size (MB)\n** Avg.

I intend to check in an Excel spreadsheet that allows people to estimate memory and disk usage for trunk.  I propose to put it under dev-tools, as I don't think it should be official documentation just yet and like the IDE stuff, we'll see how well it gets maintained.",
