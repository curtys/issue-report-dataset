    "description": "In order to fix it I made two changes, both really simple.\n\nFirst I added to org/apache/lucene/store/GCJIndexInput.cc some code to use windows memory-mapped I/O instead than unix mmap().\n\nThen I had to rearrange the link order in the Makefile in order to avoid unresolved symbol errors. Also to build repeatedly I had to instruct make to ignore the return code for the mkdir command as on windows it fails if the directory already exists.\n\nI'm attaching two patches corresponding to the changes; please note that with the patches applied, the gcj target still works on linux. Both patches apply cleanly to the current svn head.",
