True, but you know how we are about adding methods to an interface! \nYonik said it: Because nobody can change a static variable in an interface (its always final), there is no posibility to change the cache impl, so nobody would ever implement FieldCache. A short notice should be enough.\n\nShould I fix this together with LUCENE-1701? If yes, I would assign myself to this issue and add this to my own patch (which also fixes some issues by making the default parsers public).\n\nI would then only deprecate  ExtendedFieldCache (as sub-interface of FieldCache, without new methods) and merge the two package-private impls behind.\n",

As Yonik pointed out, this is unlikely the case, as there is no possibility to plug this implementation into Lucene, because you *cannot* change the FieldCache.DEFAULT interface variable (static final). Because of this nobody would ever want to implement this interface, and if he does, it would be nonsense and can break without problems.\n\nSo, removing/changing this interfaces would *not* be a BW break, as long as we only think of implementing FieldCache/ExtendedFieldCache\n\nBut we would really break backwards compatibility for all who *refer* to this interface! And because of this, the dummy stub keeps there, that classes still referencing parsers and ExtendedFieldCache.EXT_DEFAULT can still work.\n\nWe should here think about not that this *theoretically* breaks bw, we should discuss where this break would affect users.",
