Now it only locks correctly before creating the WeakHashMap at all and when requesting/putting entries. The only problem is, that two threads may create the same DocIdSet at the same time because of cache miss, but that is not a problem at all for correct behaviour.",

    "description": "CachingSpanFilter and CachingWrapperFilter expose their internal cache via a protected member which is lazily instantiated in the getDocSetId method. The current code yields the chance to double instantiate the cache and internally synchronizes on a protected none final member. My first guess is that this member was exposed for testing purposes so it should rather be changed to package private. \n\nThis patch breaks backwards compat while I guess the cleanup is kind of worth breaking it.",
