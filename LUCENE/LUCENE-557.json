If LUCENE-569 does get fixed, no changes to SpanScorer for explain should be needed.\n\nRecent mailing list discussion on the merits of changing the Explanation API to deal with the remaining cases...\n\nhttp://www.nabble.com/BooleanWeight.normalize%28float%29-doesn%27t-normalize-prohibited-clauses--t1596471.html#a4347644\n\nI'm going to let all of this sit for a bit and revisit it later.",
