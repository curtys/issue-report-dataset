Wikipedia doesn't seem to have a page for this block, and I can't find a code chart PDF for Unicode v3.0 on unicode.org, so here's the PDF for Unicode v5.1 (the latest version):\n\nhttp://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1E00.pdf\n\nProbably should check against the [Unicode 3.0 data file|http://www.unicode.org/Public/3.0-Update1/UnicodeData-3.0.1.txt] to make sure there haven't been any changes to this block between v3.0 and v5.1.0 - i.e., to make sure that the above-linked PDF is accurate for Unicode v3.0.\n\nThere is one more Latin block listed in the [Unicode 3.0 blocks data file|http://www.unicode.org/Public/3.0-Update/Blocks-3.txt]: [Latin Extended-B|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Extended-B_unicode_block].  Since many of the characters in this block don't have exact diacritic-stripped ASCII versions, maybe it could be argued that they shouldn't be included in this filter.  A fair proportion of them (maybe 40%), however, do.\n",

Java 5 support (much less Java 6 support) is still a ways off, and core Lucene can't have external dependencies.  IMO, this issue intends to provide *core* Lucene support for folding a wider set of accented characters to ASCII.\n\nIn a moment I'll attach a patch that, in addition to the larger set of accented characters to be folded that Andi has provided, folds all Unicode characters I could find to their ASCII equivalents.",

Added characters include digits and punctuation.\n\nI did not provide mappings for characters from the Math block - flattening circled plus, for example, didn't seem appropriate.\n\nI *did* provide mappings for IPA and two other phonetic character blocks, and I'm not sure whether this is appropriate.  I was following what seemed to me to be the logic of Andi's mappings, and those provided by Latin1AccentFilter: convert characters to those that *look like* them in ASCII.  As a result, e.g., the character described as \"LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED M\" (U+0270) from the IPA block is mapped to \"m\", regardless of its actual phonetic value.\n\nThere are lots of mappings in there now.  I generated the mappings by Perl scripting over the contents of the Unicode 5.1 version of UnicodeData.txt from Unicode.org, after grep'ing e.g. for \"LATIN\" and \"LETTER\" or \"DIGRAPH\", etc., and then moved things around to the appropriate places by hand.  I guess this is one weakness of this patch: it's large enough that manual verification is tough.  It's my hope that adding the Unicode character descriptions will allow for at least improved verifiability.",

It is intended to supercede ISOLatin1AccentFilter which should get deprecated.",
