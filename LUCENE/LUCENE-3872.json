I guess i feel close() should really be rollback(). But this is likely ridiculous to change.\nSo on second thought I think patch is good... if someone is handling exceptional cases like this they should be thinking about using rollback() anyway,\nand they have this option still.\n\nI wasn't really against the patch anyway, just whining. its definitely an improvement on the current behavior, let's do it.\n",

I think this feeling of unease is fairly common -- see JDBC's Connection javadoc on close, for example: \"It is strongly recommended that an application explicitly commits or rolls back an active transaction prior to calling the close method. If the close method is called and there is an active transaction, the results are implementation-defined.\"",
