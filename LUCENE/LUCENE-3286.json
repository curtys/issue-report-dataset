To make the directory layout more standard, I will:\n\n- Move the packages from xml-query-parser/src/demo/java into demo/src/java\n- Move the contents xml-query-parser/src/demo/WebContent into demo/src/resources/org/apache/lucene/demo/xmlqp/\n\nIts a bit ugly still, but when the demo contrib grows we might be able to clean it up someway.",

Once this is committed, I'll be moving the XML qp into the QP module so the dependency will change.\n\nThis also adds the servlet-api dependency as a lib to the demo module.  I noticed before it was an optional dependency and IntelliJ was tacking on Solr's version.  This makes it cleaner and standard.\n\nCommand for patch coming up.",

The target seems a little inflexible since if any dependent code is moved, it doesn't work anymore.  Yet it seems useful for testing changes that are compatible.",
