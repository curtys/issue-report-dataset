And I don't know how the heck distances acts as a cache - no code inserts anything into it. It looks like it can just be used as a user override for pre chosen docs? They fill it and pass it?\n\nSome of this spatial code is kind of hairy - and the tests/javadoc are very sparse. Many methods,constructors are not called anywhere (tests or not). Some are just called from random main methods.",
