The idea behind this patch is only that everybody working on flex should scroll through it and verify that actually changed files are fine; e.g. we did not miss a change to trunk in flex (such a missing merge would apply as a \"revert\" in the patch).\n\nMy working copy tests fine, only solr is not compiling anymore because of recent changes in NumericUtils internal class that are non backwards compatible. I will commit this patch before and break solr, but will fix it soon!",
