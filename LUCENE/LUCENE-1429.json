    "description": "Spinoff from http://www.nabble.com/IllegalStateEx-thrown-when-calling-close-to20201825.html\n\nWhen IndexWriter hits an OOME, it records this and then if close() is\ncalled it calls rollback() instead.  This is a defensive measure, in\ncase the OOME corrupted the internal buffered state (added/deleted\ndocs).\n\nBut there's a bug: if you opened IndexWriter with autoCommit true,\nclose() then incorrectly throws an IllegalStatException.\n\nThis fix is simple: allow rollback to be called even if autoCommit is\ntrue, internally during close.  (External calls to rollback with\nautoCommmit true is still not allowed).\n",
