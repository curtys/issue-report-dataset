    "description": "Few fixes and improvements for the search quality benchmark package:\n- flush report and logger at the end (otherwise long submission reports might miss last lines).\n- add run-tag-name to submission report (API change).\n- add control over max-#queries to run (useful at debugging a quality evaluation setup).\n- move control over max-docs-to-retrieve from benchmark constructor to a setter method (API change).\n- add computation of Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) in QualityStats.\n- QualityStats fixed to not fail if there are no results to average.\n- Add a TREC queries reader adequate for the 1MQ track (track started 2007).\n\nAll tests pass, will commit this in 1-2 days if there is no objection.\n",
