    "description": "Some small changes:\n\n  * Allow specifying a priority for BG threads, after the \"&\"\n    character; priority increment is + or - int that's added to main\n    thread's priority to set child thread's.  For my NRT tests I make\n    the reopen thread +2, the indexing threads +1, and leave searching\n    threads at their default.\n\n  * Added test case\n\n  * NearRealTimeReopenTask now reports @ the end the full array of\n    msec of each reopen latency\n\n  * Added optional breakout of counts by time steps.  If you set\n    log.time.step.msec to eg 1000 then reported counts for serial task\n    sequence is broken out by 1 second windows.  EG you can use this\n    to measure slowdown over time.\n",
