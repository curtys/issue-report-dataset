            "body": "This is a great idea. We should also allow one to plug in a PayloadProcessorProvider so he can rewrite the payload \"on the go\" if need be.\n\nAlso, while the index is being upgraded, I think it will be useful if we merge the segments that are upgraded, however not do cascading merges. Since segments are rewritten anyway, we can only gain from the merge. As always, if not everybody agree on this, we can make it a parameter.\n\nAnd let's make sure that whatever 'upgrade' means is at the application control. I.e., upgrade can be simply upgrading from 3x to 4.0, but it can also be using PayloadProcessorProvider as well suddenly deciding that all segments should be compound. I'm pretty sure I'll want to control the first two, not so about the last one.\n\nIt can be a simple 'boolean shouldUpgradeSegment(SegmentInfo)' on this UpgradeMP, which apps can override.",

When this is done, all of them should contain exactly one segment (because all segments previously in index are older version, so they are merged/optimized together in new format). It also verifies all segment versions to be Constants.LUCENE_MAIN_VERSION.\n- It tries to upgrade two old, already optimized indexes (with prev version, I changed TestBackwards in my 3.1 checkout to generate those). It verifies the segment versions after the upgrade. This special case is needed, as optimizing a one-segment index is a no-op without the special merge-policy\n- It uses the old optimized indexes, opens them using standard merge policy and adds some documents to them. After that it upgrades the index with a new IndexWriter using the special merge policy. In that case (as some segments are already in new version), the index should only have the old-segments merged together, the newly added ones are untouched. So segment is verified to be count > 1.",

So after the first iteration all segments will be upgraded, so on the next run of this policy, it will return null merges.\n\nThe other ideas like PayloadProcessor can be done outside of that in user code (but beware, it will not touch segments already in new version).",

Upgrading an index with more than one commit point is hairy (I think it's fine not to support this case... but we should not remove the commits).",

    "description": "Currently if you want to upgrade an old index to the format of your current Lucene version, you have to optimize your index or use addIndexes(IndexReader...) [see LUCENE-2893] to copy to a new directory. The optimize() approach fails if your index is already optimized.\n\nI propose to add a custom MergePolicy to upgrade all segments to the last format. This MergePolicy could simply also ignore all segments already up-to-date. All segments in prior formats would be merged to a new segment using another MergePolicy's optimize strategy.\n\nThis issue is different from LUCENE-2893, as it would only support upgrading indexes from previous Lucene versions in-place using the official path. Its a tool for the end user, not a developer tool.\n\nThis addition should also go to Lucene 3.x, as we need to make users with pre-3.0 indexes go the step through 3.x, else they would not be able to open their index with 4.0. With this tool in 3.x the users could safely upgrade their index without relying on optimize to work on already-optimized indexes.",
