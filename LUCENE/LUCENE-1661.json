    "description": "Hi,\n\nCurrently I'm using SortField for the creation of FieldComparators, but I ran into an issue.\nI cannot invoke SortField.getComparator(...) directly from my code, which forces me to use a  workaround. (subclass SortField and override the getComparator method with visiblity public)\nI'm proposing to make this method public. Currently I do not see any problems changing the visibility to public, I do not know if there are any (and the reason why this method is currently protected)\nI think that this is a cleaner solution then the workaround I used and also other developers can benefit from it. I will also attach a patch to this issue based on the code in the trunk (26th of May). place). \nPlease let me know your thoughts about this.\n\nCheers,\n\nMartijn\n\n ",
