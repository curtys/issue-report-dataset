And so if you kept using non payloadspans functionality, you would be set, and if you tried to use payloadspans you would get an exception saying the class needed to be updated? But if you make it abstract, we lose jar drop (I know I've read we don't have it for this release anyway) in and everyone has to implement the method. At least with the exception, if you are using the class as you used to, you can continue to do so with no work? Not that I 've considered it for very long at the moment.\n\nI know, I see your point - this back compat stuff is always dicey - thats why I throw it out there with a question mark - hopefully others will continue to chime in.\n- Show quoted text -",

PayloadSpans is dropped and moved to Spans. Back compat was so out the window anyway, its much better to just make users with custom SpanQuerys implement the new methods. You can always return unavailable payload, and empty payload set, or even not implement and avoid the functionality.\n\n2. Add a constructor arg to turn off payload collecting for an ordered spannear - it did not lazy load as the payloads javadoc said - the others do, but not ordered spanear. This should let you ignore the new functionality if you don't want to implement - without this, if you had payloads but didn't want to implement, this would blow up at just the sight of payloads. Even if you didn't have a custom SpanQuery to worry about, the query would be much slower if you had payloads but didnt need the query to interact with them - they would be loaded anyway (and its not even always efficient loading - sometimes it has to load a few uneeded payloads that later get dropped) - so you need a way to turn off loading.",
