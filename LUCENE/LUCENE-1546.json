This class produced on compilation an deprecation warning on doCommit() without any hint to this method in my code (I did not implement doCommit nor used the method).\nIt seems, that javac from 1.5 needs the deprecation also in the subclasses. With this patch applied, the own subclass did not produce the warning anymore.",
