It would be awesome (and, amazing) if JFlex enabled some kind of inheritance.\n\nSince WikipediaTokenizer doesn't have the backwards compat requirement of StandardTokenizer, you can presumably just fix ACRONYM in WikipediaTokenizer to not match host names (ie hardwire to \"true\")?",

I am glad we are moving to have the bug fixed by default, rather than the other way around.\n\nPlease indulge me a couple of small nitpicks before I get to my main point in another comment\n* Your comment above the static initializer is not correct:\n{noformat}\n  // Default to false (fixed the bug), unless the system prop is set\n{noformat}\nshould read:\n{noformat}\n  // Default to true (fixed the bug), unless the system prop is set\n{noformat}\n* The re-use of the variable a in TestStandardAnalyzer.testDomainNames() does not really guarantee that you are testing the default behaviour of StandardAnalyzer.\nI would recommend resetting a in setUp(), or explicitly constructing it in test method.\n\nGiven that the code is \"temporary\" until v3.0, feel free to ignore me ;)",

            "body": "I love the solution you have come up with, but would suggest that it is moved to StandardTokenizer instead of StandardAnalyzer.\nStandardTokenizer is the class with the actual problem. Fixing it there would mean that everyone that uses StandardTokenizer gets a default fix, not just StandardAnalyzer.\n\nFor instance, see LUCENE-1373, where most of the contrib Analyzers still suffer the buggy behavior with no workaround available.\nI think that moving your \"defaulting logic\" to the tokenizer would fix all these Analyzers in one fell swoop.\n\nI would provide suggested patches, but I am just about to go on holidays for 3 weeks. Is there a planned release date for v2.3.3 or v2.4?",
