Not all extended classes implement it this way BTW. SegmentReader just calls deletedDocs.count(), rather then calling the two separate methods.",

What if we implement numDeletedDocs() in IndexReader, instead of defining it abstract?\n\nRight, that's exactly what I'm thinking, with this body:\n\n{code}\npublic int numDeletedDocs() {\n  return maxDoc() - numDocs();\n}\n{code}\n\nThen I think no classes need to override it (perf cost of calling 2 methods is tiny)?",
