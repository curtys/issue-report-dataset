It's a stretch, security-wise, I know, but I don't see how it serves any useful purpose.  We have signatures/logs/SVN tags so we know who built the particular item w/o needing to know what their local user account name is.\n\nThe fix is:\n\n{code}\nIndex: common-build.xml\n===================================================================\n--- common-build.xml    (revision 661027)\n+++ common-build.xml    (working copy)\n@@ -281,7 +281,7 @@\n                <attribute name=\"Implementation-Title\" value=\"org.apache.lucene\"/>\n                <!-- impl version can be any string -->\n                <attribute name=\"Implementation-Version\"\n-                          value=\"${version} ${svnversion} - ${user.name} - ${DSTAMP} ${TSTAMP}\"/>\n+                          value=\"${version} ${svnversion} - ${DSTAMP} ${TSTAMP}\"/>\n                <attribute name=\"Implementation-Vendor\"\n                           value=\"The Apache Software Foundation\"/>\n                <attribute name=\"X-Compile-Source-JDK\" \n{code} ",
