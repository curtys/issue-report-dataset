Yet, it must exist, because our caller holds\n      // the write lock.  This can happen when the directory\n      // listing was stale (eg when index accessed via NFS\n      // client with stale directory listing cache).  So we\n      // try now to explicitly open this commit point:\n      SegmentInfos sis = new SegmentInfos();\n      try {\n        sis.read(directory, segmentInfos.getCurrentSegmentFileName(), codecs);\n      } catch (IOException e) {\n        throw new CorruptIndexException(\"failed to locate current segments_N file\");\n      }\n{code}\n\nLooks like this code protects against a real problem, which was raised on the list a couple of times already - stale NFS cache. So I'm reluctant to remove that check ... thought I still think we should differentiate between a newly created index on a fresh Directory, to a stale NFS problem. Maybe we can pass a boolean isNew or something like that to the ctor, and if it's a new index and the last commit point is missing, IFD will not throw the exception, but silently ignore that? So the code would become something like this:\n{code}\n    if (currentCommitPoint == null && !isNew) {\n       ....\n    }\n{code}\n\nDoes this make sense, or am I missing something?",

One thing that I think should be fixed is testImmediateDiskFull - if I don't add writer.commit(), the test fails, because dir.getRecomputeActualSizeInBytes returns 0 (no RAMFiles yet), and then the test succeeds at adding one document. So maybe just change the test to set maxSizeInBytes to '1', always?\n\nTestNoDeletionPolicy is not covered by this patch (should be fixed as well, because now the number of commits is exactly N and not N+1). Will fix it tomorrow.\n\nAnyway, it's really late now, so hopefully some fresh eyes will look at it while I'm away, and comment on the proposed changes. I hope I got all the changes to the tests right.",

Did it and it works.\n\nNow ... one thing I haven't mentioned is the bw break. This is a behavioral bw break, which specifically I'm not so sure we should care about, because I wonder how many apps out there rely on being able to open a reader before they ever commited on a fresh new index. So what do you think - do this change anyway, OR ... utilize Version to our aid? I.e., if the Version that was passed to IWC is before LUCENE_31, we keep the initial commit, otherwise we don't do it? Pros is that I won't need to change many of the tests because they still use the LUCENE_30 version (but that is not a strong argument), so it's a weak Pro. Cons is that IW will keep having that doCommit handling in its ctor, only now w/ added comments on why this is being kept around etc.\n\nWhat do you think?",

I tried writing the following test:\n\n{code}\n  public void testNoCommits() throws Exception {\n    // Tests that if we don't call commit(), the directory has 0 commits. This has\n    // changed since LUCENE-2386, where before IW would always commit on a fresh\n    // new index.\n    Directory dir = new RAMDirectory();\n    IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(dir, new IndexWriterConfig(TEST_VERSION_CURRENT, new WhitespaceAnalyzer(TEST_VERSION_CURRENT)));\n    assertEquals(\"expected 0 commits!\", 0, IndexReader.listCommits(dir).size());\n    // No changes still should generate a commit, because it's a new index.\n    writer.close();\n    assertEquals(\"expected 1 commits!\", 0, IndexReader.listCommits(dir).size());\n  }\n{code}\n\nSimple test - validates that no commits are present following a freshly new index creation, w/o closing or committing. However, IndexReader.listCommits fails w/ the following exception:\n\n{code}\njava.io.FileNotFoundException: no segments* file found in org.apache.lucene.store.RAMDirectory@2d262d26: files: []\n\tat org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentInfos$FindSegmentsFile.run(SegmentInfos.java:652)\n\tat org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentInfos$FindSegmentsFile.run(SegmentInfos.java:535)\n\tat org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentInfos.read(SegmentInfos.java:323)\n\tat org.apache.lucene.index.DirectoryReader.listCommits(DirectoryReader.java:1033)\n\tat org.apache.lucene.index.DirectoryReader.listCommits(DirectoryReader.java:1023)\n\tat org.apache.lucene.index.IndexReader.listCommits(IndexReader.java:1341)\n\tat org.apache.lucene.index.TestIndexWriter.testNoCommits(TestIndexWriter.java:4966)\n       ....\n{code}\n\nThe failure occurs when SegmentInfos attempts to find segments.gen and fails. So I wonder if I should fix DirectoryReader to catch that exception and simply return an empty Collection .. or I should fix SegmentInfos at this point -- notice the \"files: []\" at the end - I think that by adding a check to the following code (SegmentInfos, line 652) which validates that there were any files before throwing the exception, it'll still work properly and safely (i.e. to detect a problematic Directory). Will need probably to break away from the while loop and I guess fix some other things in upper layers ... therefore I'm not sure if I should not simply catch that exception in DirectoryReader.listCommits w/ proper documentation and be done w/ it. After all, it's not supposed to be called ... ever? or hardly ever?\n\n{code}\n          if (gen == -1) {\n            // Neither approach found a generation\n            throw new FileNotFoundException(\"no segments* file found in \" + directory + \": files: \" + Arrays.toString(files));\n          }\n{code}",

            "body": "As I indicated in an email, Solr tests failed (sorry for not running them before). After some investigation (thanks Robert !), that's the problem: before this change, IW always committed first on an empty directory. It called SegmentInfos.commit(dir), which by a chain of calls ensured the directory exists (in FSDir) by calling file.mkdirs().\n\nAfter this change, that chain of calls did not happen ... yet somehow tests we still passing for Lucene. Some investigation shows that the Solr tests that failed used SingleInstanceLockFactory, or NoLockFactory. By default, FSDir uses either SimpleFSLF or NativeFSLF. The IW.ctor calls LF.makeLock and obtain, which for these two LFs meant that calling file.mkdirs ... and thus the problem was hidden. SingleInstanceLF and NoLF don't do that !\n\nSo first, a test which uses FSDir and one of these LFs need to be created, so we catch that problem in Lucene code (this is not related to Solr -- just a missing test in Lucene). Second we need to fix IW ctor, or Dir or whatever.\n\nI've added that code to IW.ctor, as a sanity check to make sure it works - and indeed all Solr tests pass. So that's one option, even though a bit messy.\n{code}\ntry {\n  directory.createOutput(\"temp\").close();\n} finally {\n  directory.deleteFile(\"temp\");\n}\n{code}\n\nAnother option is to add to Directory a prepareForWrite() or simply prepare() which will be called by IW. A default empty impl on Directory, and file.mkdirs on FSDirectory should be enough.\n\nA third option is to define clear semantics for dir.listAll(), to throw a NoSuchDirectoryException and then change IndexFileDeleter to ignore that exception if OpenMode of IW is CREATE*. It kind of makes sense - if the directory is empty, why bother looking for any index files. Lucene code today already expects that exception to be thrown in SegmentInfos.getCurrentSegmentGeneration -- so we kind of say 'either you use RAMDirectory, or a sub-class of FSDirectory, and then that's what we expect'. So it's not so much of a backwards change ...\n\nWhile dir.prepare() or prepareForWrite() is very explicit ... it's not protective enough - one can still call listAll w/o calling prepareForWrite (why would you call it if you just want to list files) so I'm not sure which is the best option ... Maybe the last option is the best as at least the caller should not assume anything about the state of the directory. Just prepare to handle the NoSuchDirectoryException, vs. 'there is a directory but it's empty' case.\n\nI'll revert my commit until this is resolved.",

That just seems wrong to me ... when I fixed the tests to not rely on the buggy behavior, I noticed several which count the list of commits (especially the IDP ones) w/ a documentation like \"1 for opening + N for committing\" ...\n\nIt just looks weird that when you open IW a commit happens, a set of empty files are created, but from now on they are never modified, until IDP kicks in, after the second commit ... it's nothing like initing the Directory to be able to receive input ..\n\nAnd I don't know what's the benefit of doing \"new IW()\" following by \"IR.open()\" ... that IR will always see 0 documents, until you call reopen (if commit happened in between). So what's the convenience here? that your code can call IR.open once, and from that point forward just 'reopen()'? That seems low advantage to me, really. Maybe what we should do is fix IR.open to return a null IR in case the directory hasn't been populated w/ anything yet. Then you can check easily if you should call open() (==null) or reopen (otherwise). Or create a blank stub of IR which emulates an empty Dir, and when reopen is called works well (if the Directory is not empty now) ...\n\nBTW, FWIW, Solr's code did not break from this change at all ... it was the combination of FSDir and NoLF/SingleInstanceLF that broke some tests that used it ... I don't know how many apps out there are using that combination, but I'd bet it's small? I use that combination, however in my case an IR is opened only after a commit signal/event is raised (so I don't check isCurrent often or attempt to reopen()). What I'm trying to say is that this combination is dangerous, and the application needs to ensure that only one IW is open at any given time, and I'm sure such apps are more sophisticated then opening IW and then IR just for the convenience of it.",

My app, for example, opens an IR and does scheduled reopens. The time interval is small, a reopen over unmodified index is a noop, so this is all beautifully simple and just as effective as waiting for a commit event (like I did in the past, just like you). It opens an IndexWriter with CREATE_OR_APPEND mode before opening the first reader, and is thus guaranteed to have a good index directory regardless of the situation.\nImmediate fix I see is to check whether the directory is empty and do a first empty commit myself - UGLY.",

Isn't opening IW with CREATE* mode called \"specifically asking for\"?\n\nIt depends on how you interpret the mode ... for example, you cannot pass OpenMode.APPEND for an empty Directory, because IW throws an exception. The modes are just meant to tell IW how to behave:\n* APPEND - I know there is an index in the Directory, and I'd like to append to it.\n* CREATE - I don't care if there is an index in the Directory -- create a new one, zeroing out all segments.\n* CREATE_OR_APPEND - If there is an index, open it, otherwise create a new one.\n\nSo if you pass CREATE on an already populated index, IW doesn't do the implicit commit, until you call commit() yourself. But if you pass CREATE on an empty index, IW suddenly calls commit()? That's just an inconsistency that's meant to allow you to open an IR immediately after \"new IW()\" call, irregardless of what was there? And if you open that IR, then if the index was populated you see the previous set of documents, but if it wasn't you see nothing, even though you meant to say \"override what's there\"?\n\nI've checked what FileOutputStream does, using the following code:\n{code}\nFile file = new File(\"d:/temp/tmpfile\");\nFileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(file);\nfos.write(3);\nfos.close();\n\t  \nfos = new FileOutputStream(file);\nFileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);\nSystem.out.println(fis.read());\n{code}\n\n* Second line creates an empty file immediately, not waiting for close() or flush() -- which resembles the behavior that you're suggesting we should take w/ IW (which is the 'today's behavior')\n* Forth line closes the file, flushing and writing the content.\n* Fifth line *recreates* the file, empty, again, w/o calling close. So it zeros out the file content immediately, even before you wrote a single piece of byte to it.\n* Sixth+Seventh line proves it by attempting to read from the file, and the output printed is -1.\n\nI've wrapped the FOS w/ a BufferedOS and the behavior is still the same. So I'm trying to show is that we don't fully adhere to the CREATE mode, and rightfully if you ask me - we shouldn't zero out the segments until the application called commit(). But we choose to adhere differently to the CREATE* mode if the index is already populated. That's an inconsistent behavior, at least in my perspective. It's also harder to explain and document, e.g. \"you should call commit() if you used CREATE, in case you want to zero out everything immediately, and the Directory is not empty, but you don't need to call commit() if the directory was empty, Lucene will do it for you.\" -- so now how will the app know if it should call commit()? It will need to write a sort of \"emptiness-detection-then-commit\"?\n\nI am willing to consider the following semantics:\n* APPEND - assumes an index exists and open it.\n* CREATE - zeros out everything that's in the directory *immediately*, and also prepares an empty directory.\n* CREATE_OR_APPEND - either loads an existing index, or is able to work on the empty directory. No implicit commit is happening by IW if the index does not exist.\n\nBut I think CREATE is too dangerous, and so I prefer to stick w/ the proposed change to the patch so far -- if you open an index in CREATE*, you should call commit before you can read it. That will adhere to the semantics of what the application wanted, whether it meant to zero out an existing Directory, or create a new one from scratch.",
