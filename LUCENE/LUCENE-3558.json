But we can still do that if it is in core... I will mover the NRTCachingDirectory in a different issue.\n\nbq. I'm curious why you used svn copy instead of svn move?\n\nI used svn cp since the patch removes the files and otherwise some systems have problems if the files don't exist anymore. I used svn mv to create the patch actually :)",
