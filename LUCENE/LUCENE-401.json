    "description": "I've modified the Makefile so that it compiles with GCJ-4.0.\n\nThis involved fixing the CORE_OBJ macro to match the generated jar file as well\nas excluding FieldCacheImpl from being used from its .java source (GCJ has\nproblems with anonymous inner classes, I guess).\n\nAlso, I changed the behaviour of FieldInfos.fieldInfo(int). It depended on\ncatching IndexOutOfBoundsException exception. I've modified it to test the\nbounds first, returning -1 in that case. This helps with gcj since we build with\n-fno-bounds-check.\n\nI compiled with;\n\nGCJ=gcj-4.0 GCJH=gcjh-4.0 GPLUSPLUS=g++-4.0 ant clean gcj\n\npatch to follow.",
