You must have a bigger brain than me...\n\nAs a matter of fact, I think you're right.   Fcntl locks have two major\ndrawbacks, and upon review I think NativeFSLockFactory avoids both of them.\n\nThe first is that opening and closing a file releases all locks for the entire\nprocess.  Even if you never request a lock on the second filehandle, or if you\nrequest a lock and the request is denied, closing the filehandle releases the\nlock on the first filehandle.  But NativeFSLockFactory avoids that problem by\nkeeping the HashSet of filepaths and ensuring that the same file is never\nopened twice.  Furthermore, since the lockfiles are private to Lucene, you can\nassume that nobody else is going to open them and inadvertently spoil the lock.\n\nThe second is that child processes spawned via fork() do not inherit locks\nfrom the parent process.  If you assume that nobody's ever going to fork a\nJava process, that's not relevant.  (Too bad that won't work for Lucy... we\nhave to support fork().)\n\nI think you're probably safe with Fcntl locks on all non-shared volumes.",

That digest is problematic when two different machines access the same physical dir via different mount names, since that results in different lock file names. \n\nThe digest problem is not easy to solve: It happens for all LockFactories if they are not automatically created (when LockFactory==null). As soon as you call FSDir.open(..., new SimpleLockFactory(...)) you also get this prefix. It does not appear, when the FSDir is created by FSDir.getDirectory(), as the init() method cleans the lockPrefix directly after setting the lockfactory (the lock factory setter sets the prefix).\n\nThe prefix is only important, if the lock is not placed inside the index directory. The best would be that FSDir would simply return null in getLockId(), when the LockFactory uses the same path as the Directory.

This prevents the LockFactory from creating the directory when not needed (e.g. opening non-existent index).\n\nI have one idea (which is  a new feature): How about providing a ctor to NativeFSLockFactory and SimpleFSLockFactory without param. When this LF is added to a FSDir, it would default to set the LockDir to itsself (if lf.getLockDir()==null) lf.setLockDir(this.directory)).

            "body": "FYI: other Java projects also implement exclusive locking, and automatic removal of such a file. \n\nApache Jackrabbit uses FileChannel.lock() by default, but there are problems with some NFS implementations (some don't release the lock after restart, some don't support locks at all). Also, some operating systems / file systems allow multiple write locks within the same process (possibly in different class loaders). Jackrabbit works around that by (mis-)using a system property. See http://wiki.apache.org/jackrabbit/RepositoryLock\n\nFor the H2 Database Engine I implemented a cooperative locking mechanism: http://www.h2database.com/html/advanced.html#file_locking_protocols - I have also ported that to Apache Jackrabbit (\"Cooperative File Lock Mechanism\"). It always works, but needs a background thread. H2 also supports a mechanism based on a server socket (open a server socket and write the IP address and port to the file) - but this is problematic if the network is misconfigured (localhost not bound to 127.0.0.1 and such) which does happen in practice.",

Is it possible to exceed the polling interval for a low\npriority process on a system under heavy load?  What happens when the app\nsleeps?\n\nFor removing stale lock files, another technique is to incorporate the host\nname and the pid.  So long as you can determine that the lock file belongs to\nyour machine and that the PID is not active, you can safely zap it.\n\nThen tricky bit is how you get that information into the lock file.  If you\ntry to write that info to the lock file itself after an O_EXCL open, creating\na fully valid lock file is no longer an atomic operation.  \n\nThe approach suggested by the creat(2) man page and endorsed in the Linux NFS\nFAQ involves hard links:\n\n{noformat}\n    The solution for performing atomic file locking using a lockfile\n    is to create a unique file on the same file system (e.g.,\n    incorporating hostname and pid), use link(2) to make a link to the\n    lockfile. If link() returns 0, the lock is successful. Otherwise,\n    use stat(2) on the unique file to check if its link count has\n    increased to 2, in which case the lock is also successful. \n{noformat}\n\nThis approach should also work on Windows for NTFS file systems since Windows\n2000 thanks to the CreateHardLink() function.  (Samba file shares, you're out\nof luck.)  However, I'm not sure about the state of support for hard links in\nJava.\n\nIf you're interested in continuing this discussion, we should probably take it\nsomewhere other than this closed issue.",

It's still possible the thread isn't run at all, but highly unlikely. High priority threads are quite reliable. I wrote a MP3 player in Java (mp3transform) which I used a lot, I never heard any gaps. If the thread can be avoided, that would be great of course. I'm just trying to say that in theory, the thread is problematic, but in practice it isn't. While file locking is not a problem in theory, but in practice.\n\n> What happens when the app sleeps?\n\nGood question! Standby / hibernate are not supported. I didn't think about that. Is there a way to detect the wakeup?\n\n> host name and the pid\n\nYes. It is not so easy to get the PID in Java, I found: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35842/process-id-in-java \"ManagementFactory.getRuntimeMXBean().getName()\". What do you do if the lock was generated by another machine? I tried with using a server socket, so you need the IP address, but unfortunately, sometimes the network is not configured correctly (but maybe it's possible to detect that). Maybe the two machines can't access each other over TCP/IP.\n\n> hard links\n\nYes, but it looks like this doesn't work always.\n\n",
