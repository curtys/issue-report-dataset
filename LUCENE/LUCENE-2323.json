I.e., unless we want to have o.a.l.qp, it doesn't mean that all QPs under contrib/queryParser need to belong to the same package. If it makes sense for all of them to belong to o.a.l.search (as an example), then that's where they should go, IMO.\n\nSo I think it's ok if under contrib/queryparser or contrib/analyzers you'll see packages like o.a.l.analysis.ar/fr/snowball, as well as I'm perfectly fine if all of them exist under o.a.l.analysis. Analysis makes sense as a package name.",

I think one specific example was that some poeple might want a few langauge specific analyzers, but not all of them -- and if they have no direct dependencies on each other (just core) we should try to build/distribute them as (tiny) individual Jars -- and possible in (big) bundled jars as well.\n\nSo while it might make a lot of sense to organize some existing contribs into logical \"groups\" which might get build up in big bundled jars, there are likely going to be people who still want to comsume the existing jars (or even more granular jars)\n\nLooking at the specific suggestions robert made: it makes sense to logically organize all the query parsers under a common directory, but how many users are actually using more then one and are we doing them a disservice if we only ship them in one big jar?   Ditto for the highlighters (does anyone besides Solr use *both* highlighters in a single application?)",

IIRC the idea in this discussion was the have a lot more smaller \"modules\", with a lot better defined/advertised dependencies, so that module X,Y,Z might all depend on modules A, and B (which had the common refactored code you speak of) and the \"core\" module is special in that it must never depend on anything else.\n\nLike i said: I personally don't have a very strong opinion about this, i think people who are really concerned about jar sizes can compile their own after pruning the classes they don't care about -- but it's definitely harder when those classes are all in one atomic source tree where you might not notice that someone refactored a common dependency that wasn't there before.\n",

            "body": "Robert - I think that's exactly what I was proposing. You indicated that there are some components under contrib that you cannot move around because their package names would change, and I said that I don't think their package names should change :). So you can move XMLQP under contrib/queryparsers and its package name will stay the same ...\n\nI also think that at least for analyzers, having all of them under one contrib jar will allow us to improve the way our users interact w/ analyzers. Consider for example an AnalyzerFactory which when receiving a Locale returns a pre-configured Analyzer, the best one we can think of for that Locale. That's (to me) a great service to our users, and I don't see how we can do that if all analyzers are under different modules. Besides, analyzers are logically close to each other because they perform a very specific task. Refactoring the analysis API again would be easier of all of them were under the same root directory ... less chance of missing some.\n\nQuery parsers are different because I agree a user will likely pick one for his app and go with it. But I don't think we're talking about massive amount of code here right? So again it makes sense to bundle them up together. We can have a module-level documentation of the different query parsers, pros and cons for each, use cases etc., and then the user can pick. If jar size is important to someone, then I think that someone is already recompiling everything to include just what he needs, and so we're not hurting anyone here.\n\nTherefore I see this reorg as a logical and important step towards modularization.",
