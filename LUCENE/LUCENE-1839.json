    "description": "Suggest having Scorer implement explain to throw UnsupportedOperationException\n\nright now, i have to implement this method (because its abstract), and javac yells at me for overriding a deprecated method\n\nif the following implementation is in Scorer, i can remove my \"empty\" implementations of explain from my Scorers\n{code}\n  /** Returns an explanation of the score for a document.\n   * <br>When this method is used, the {@link #next()}, {@link #skipTo(int)} and\n   * {@link #score(HitCollector)} methods should not be used.\n   * @param doc The document number for the explanation.\n   *\n   * @deprecated Please use {@link IndexSearcher#explain}\n   * or {@link Weight#explain} instead.\n   */\n  public Explanation explain(int doc) throws IOException {\n    throw new UnsupportedOperationException();\n  }\n{code}\n\nbest i figure, this shouldn't break back compat (people already have to recompile anyway) (2.9 definitely not binary compatible with 2.4)\n",
