I forgot about LUCENE-3069, but, yes this is very similar.\n\nBut I think one difference is LUCENE-3069 aims to have all terms memory resident but postings would still reside in the Directory, I think?  Whereas my patch here puts all terms and postings in RAM (in a single FST).  The postings format is similar to what PulsingCodec does, ie, doc + tf + pos + payload are all serialized into a single byte[] using delta vInts.\n\nSo I think we should keep LUCENE-3069 open, as an enhancement to this codec to make it separately controllable whether postings should also be in RAM?",
