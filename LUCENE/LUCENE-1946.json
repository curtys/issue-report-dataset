            "body": "One general question:\n\nMy last patch also removes the ISOLatin1AccentFilter, because it is deprecated. The problem with removing this filter is, that current indexes cannot be used anymore, because you have no possibility to add new documents using this filter in 3.0 or do queries with accents against it. Maybe we should leave this class deprecated alive or move it to contrib? Or we force people to reindex.\n\nThe same applies to DateField from the o.a.l.document package. It is deprecated, so no one should use it, but we cannot remove it, because existing indexes need this support. This is different for e.g. Field.Store.COMPRESS, because you can still read the indexes (decompression is automatically), and can add new content without compression. Or reindex and use a own compression using byte[] stored field (as suggested).",

Nobody had problems with it (even the UIMA people were very happy about the new API, because it fits better to the UIMA architecture [they also have such things like Attribute but called different] - there was a conference about UIMA in Potsdam).\n\nI keep this patch pending (only the generics changes are submitted), but all tests for the BW compatibility were removed in my deprecated cleanup, so there are no tests for the old api anymore in trunk.",

They only problem is InstantiatedIndexWriter, which still uses the old API to consume. I will try to modify it. But maybe this contrib will get removed (see other issue LUCENE-1948).\n\nSo I will find out what to do.",

            "body": "Here the patch with all contrib's fixed:\n- PrecedenceQueryParser was missing new TokenStream API, I fixed it somehow with States and restoreState. I also added a javacc-target, which was missing\n- InstantiatedIndexWriter was also changed to use the new TokenStream API. The fix is very hackish, but works for the beginning. The class uses lots of Lists/Sets with cloned Token instances inside, so I simple used an AttributeImpl iterator and used copyTo(token). This works most cases (other cases are ignored by a empty Exception catch block). But this should really be fixed or the whole class removed (as suggested)\n\nThere is one question: I removed IsoLatin1Filter. Thismay be a backwards break, so that old indexes using this filter in the analyzer need to be reindexed. But for most cases the AccentFilter would also work, but some hits may be missing when you query such an index. What should we do. Leave the deprecated analyzer in and remove it with 4.0 when all old indexes cannot be read anymore?",

But e.g. NumberTools and DateTools will also stay deprecated in 3.0, because you need them to use Indexes from previous versions.\n\nSo there is a difference between deprecated APIs and deprecated functionality that is maybe needed, as long as old indexes are available. With 4.0 we will change the index format and then the problem is gone.\n\nBut I agree with you, the differences between both classes are so minimal and only western european languages would have used the ISO filter. The superset does not hurt, only when extended chars (>255) are involved.",
