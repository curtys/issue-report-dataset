            "body": "Attached patch.  All tests pass.\n\nThe patch adds o.a.l.util.CloseableThreadLocal.  It's a wrapper around ThreadLocal that wraps the values inside a WeakReference, but then also holds a strong reference to the value (to ensure GC doesn't reclaim it) until you call the close method.  On calling close, GC is then free to reclaim all values you had stored, regardless of how long it takes ThreadLocal's implementation to actually release its references.\n\nThere are a couple places in Lucene where I left the current usage of ThreadLocal.\n\nFirst, Analyzer.java uses ThreadLocal to hold reusable token streams.  There is no \"close\" called for Analyzer, so unless we are willing to add a finalizer to call CloseableThreadLocal.close() I think we can leave it.\n\nSecond, some of the contrib/benchmark tasks use ThreadLocal to store per-thread DateFormat which should use tiny memory.",

But not repeatable.\n\nSo I suspect the closing is kind of delayed. And sometimes it could be missed.\n\nAttaching the screenshot for the memory bump, and 2 the memory graphs of the begin and after of 2RAMDirecory in the memory(needed 2 because the time is fairly long)",

            "body": "Hmm, the sometimes long-lasting bump in Used memory is odd.\n\nWhen you close the old IndexSearcher & RAMDirectory do you forcefully dereference them (set all variables that point to them to null) before then reopening the new ones?  (Seems like you must, since you saw the V shape before LUCENE-1195, but I just want to verify).  If you simply re-assign the variable from old to new then two objects will exist at once until the opening of the new one finishes.\n\nI think the bump may just be GC taking its time collecting the objects, which should be harmless.  Maybe using a WeakReference to a long-lived object causes GC to take longer to collect?\n\nIs it possible to use the profiler to look for a reference to the old RAMDirectory while the bump is \"up\"?  That would be a smoking gun that we do still have a reference, unless it's only via the WeakReference.\n\nOr, could you try lowering the heap size in your JRE to something slightly less than 2X one RAMDirectory (but not so low that the \"other stuff\" you have in the JRE can't fit).  This would force GC to work harder / more immediately in reclaiming the unreachable objects.",

Best practice is to use remove() rather than set(null), since that would cause the WeakReference to be removed immediately, together with the value.\n\nKind regards\n\nHeinz\"",

It is also not valid, since you need to clear all values across all threads, remove() only clears the entry for the calling thread.\n\nThe current patch solves the problem suitably for Lucene, at the expense of some performance degradation.\n\n",

The current patch solves the problem suitably for Lucene, at the expense of some performance degradation.\n\nThe performance degradation should be negligible in the case of long-lived threads.  No synchronized code was added in the get() path.\n\nbq. It is also not valid, since you need to clear all values across all threads, remove() only clears the entry for the calling thread.\n\nThis best practice does work correctly: you're supposed to call remove() from the very thread that had inserted something into the ThreadLocal.\n\nBesides the 1.5 issue, this is also difficult for Lucene because we don't have a clean point to \"know\" when the thread has finished interacting with Lucene.  A thread comes out of the pool, runs a search, gathers docIDs from in a collector, returns from the search, one by one looks up stored docs / term vectors for these docIDs, maybe does secondary search up front to build up filters, etc., finishes rendering the result and returns to the pool.  Unless we create a new method \"detachThread(...)\" somewhere in Lucene, there is no natural point now to do the remove().  And I don't like creating such a method because nobody will ever know they need to call it in their App server until they start hitting cryptic OOMs.",

    "description": "Java's ThreadLocal is dangerous to use because it is able to take a\nsurprisingly very long time to release references to the values you\nstore in it.  Even when a ThreadLocal instance itself is GC'd, hard\nreferences to the values you had stored in it are easily kept for\nquite some time later.\n\nWhile this is not technically a \"memory leak\", because eventually\n(when the underlying Map that stores the values cleans up its \"stale\"\nreferences) the hard reference will be cleared, and GC can proceed,\nits end behavior is not different from a memory leak in that under the\nright situation you can easily tie up far more memory than you'd\nexpect, and then hit unexpected OOM error despite allocating an\nextremely large heap to your JVM.\n\nLucene users have hit this many times.
