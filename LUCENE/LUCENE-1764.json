            "body": "Bug was a bit strong I guess - resource hog trap? - you can sidestep this if you implement hashcode/equals on your SortComparator. We need a warning to do that I think.\n\nFor the unit test that fails, I've changed the equals/hashcode for the SortComparator to use:\n\n      //@Override\n      public int hashCode() {\n        return getClass().getName().hashCode();\n      }\n      \n      //@Override\n      public boolean equals(Object other) {\n        return this.hashCode() == other.hashCode();\n      }\n\nWe have always had the issue, because the comparator has been part of the key, and when you pass a SortField over the wire, you get a new impl of the comparator factory field thats in it.",

            "body": "I think this bug was there before. SortField has the problem that not only SortComparator, also custom parsers that are not singletons (serializable singletons using readResolve()!!!) or do not have equals/hashcode will create new cache entries each time, e.g. this one:\n\"new SortField(\"field\", new FieldCache.LongParser() { ... });\" creates a different parser instance each time and so a new cache entry is created (even in non-remote usage). This is noted in the docs.",
