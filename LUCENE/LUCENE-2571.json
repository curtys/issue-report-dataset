The long stoppages on trunk are not due to merges at all. They are due to flushing the DocumentsWriter which essentially means stop the world. This is why we can not make any progress. Merges are NOT blocking indexing on trunk no matter which MP you use. The Balanced MP is rather suited for RT environments to make reopening the reader quicker. \n\nyou should maybe look at this blog entry for a more complete explanation: http://blog.jteam.nl/2011/04/01/gimme-all-resources-you-have-i-can-use-them/",

Merges are NOT blocking indexing on trunk no matter which MP you use.\nWell.. merges tie up IO (especially if not on fancy SSDs/RAIDs), which in turn lags flushes -> bigger delays for stop the world flushes / lower bandwith cap (after which they are forced to stop the world) for parallel flushes.\n\nSo Lance's point is partially valid.",
