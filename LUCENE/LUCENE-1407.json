Now, RemoteSearchable today implements Searchalbe (and by inheritance java.rmi.Remote) as well as extend UnicastRemoteObject.\n\nAfter refactoring, it will need to extend both Searcher and UnicastRemoteObject. Unless we make Searcher extend UnicastRemoteObject, but that will bring the RMI stuff back into core.\n\nAnybody got an idea how we can work around that besides keeping Searchable, or have Searcher extend UnicastRemoteObject?",

I looked briefly at the comments and what you are doing and I feel removing Searchable in 2.9 is a heavy change and will most likely break back compat. \nThe RMI related classes this issue is about will just be moved to contrib but the problem which are you talking about will stay the same. With or without a patch for this issue.\nRemoving the RMI dependency would be a great step forward and will not keep you from working on your patch.\n\nSimon",

I feel removing Searchable in 2.9 is a heavy change and will most likely break back compat. \n\nBack-compat is already broken in 2.9 due to the Collector work. So people who extend Searcher will need to implement the new search(***, Collector) methods. As I understood it, Searcher was really a replacement for Searchable, and I suspect it was left there not deprecated just because of RMI.\n\nWe preferred to add new methods to Searcher as abstract, rather than to Searchable, b/c we want to move away from interfaces. Therefore I don't think that delaying that work will do any good - we'll have more methods to maintain on the interface as well.\n\nBut to be honest I don't know what's better. I can have Searcher extend the RMI class, but that will leave RMI in core. Or I can have Searchable implement new methods, but that won't take us in the ultimate direction we want - getting rid of interfaces.",

The object it returns from lookup is of type Remote, while if Searchable extends Remote, the object returned from lookup is Searchable. I'm still debugging this, but if someone knows what's going on, please don't be shy :)",

In fact, the type returned by lookup() is Searchable, not even RemoteSearchable.\n\nI guess we can solve it by having RemoteSearchable implement a Remoteable interface which extends Remote .. but that's just spooky. For now I left the code in LUCENE-1630 as-is in that area.",

            "body": "Shai, you miss one little tricky thing with RMI. RMI uses a DynamicProxy (java.lang.reflect.Proxy) together with a java.lang.reflect.InvocationHandler to proxy the remote call. A proxy can only be created using an interface. All calls to the interface are passed to the InvocationHandler instance and subsequently to the remote server. You can only cast an object returned by lookup() into an interface implemented by the remote object. If you would implement Remotable in you remote object you can only cast it into Remotable (while I have never seen that interface). This will only offer you the methods of this interface but not the methods of the remote object, in our case RemoteSeachable. Eventually we need an interface that defines all methods needed to use RemoteSearchable, without a base interface this is not gonna work together with RMI.\n\nsimon",
