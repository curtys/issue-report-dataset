I see that the lists are off by 1 (i.e instead of 0, 3, 6, 9 ...  it is 0, 2, 5, 8). So I don't think the failure is related to the facets code at all.\n\nI've noticed the following:\n# If I disable RandomIW, it passes\n# If I disable RandomIW.addDocument call to maybeCommit, it passes too.\n# Disabling maybeCommit.switchDoDocValues has no effect.\n\nIt's the call to w.commit() which causes the IDs to offset by 1.\n\nSince RIW.flushAt is set to 51 (w/ the above seed), you can reduce the number of docs to index to 53 and the bug will be exposed (it didn't reproduce w/ N_DOCS=52). I'll try to isolate this bug to a standalone testcase and then run on 3x too.",

            "body": "Ok I found the problem. The test relies on Lucene doc IDs to assert the results. So at first I went for disabling merges (because they removed deleted docs and screwed up the IDs), but that didn't help entirely because for some seeds, a whole segment turned up to be deleted, and thus dropped, screwing up the IDs as well.\n\nSo I fixed the test to add a stored field to all the docs that are deleted, and then instead of asserting that the returned docID was not marked for deletion, I assert that the returned document does not contain that field.\n\nI ran the test w/ -Dtests.iter=10000 (10K) and it didn't find any bad seed. Previously it hunted them pretty quickly !\n\nI'll commit a fix shortly to 3x and trunk.",
