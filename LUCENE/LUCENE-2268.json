Is the test that Uwe suggests here sufficient or is there more you'd like tested?\n\nSo far I can think of the following things that might need to be checked:\n\n- Poms are valid XML/maven poms\n- Poms include all dependencies with correct versions for their modules\n- Poms have correct groupId and artifactId\n- Artifacts for all modules are created\n- Artifacts match those created through the official ant build\n\nToo far or have I missed some?",

            "body": "Chris, these sound like great checks...\n\nI'm not really sure what is involved to know that poms/artifacts are correct, but at the moment since we have no checks, even adding one of these checks is an improvement (for example: is the pom even valid xml at all)...\n\nI figure its like any other feature, we won't immediately have perfect tests but we can improve them iteratively.",

            "body": "Much of these are handled by Maven itself:\n\nbq. Poms are valid XML/maven poms\n\nMaven validates the poms itself before it begins the build process.  Poms themselves have an XSD which you'll usually linked in the XML.  Consequently if the pom is not valid XML (oops! forgot the </dependency>) then the build will fail.  \n\nbq. Poms include all dependencies with correct versions for their modules\n\nFor the Maven build to run successfully it must be able to compile the source.  To do so the classpath must contain all the necessary dependencies.  Only those dependencies specified in the poms will be added to the classpath.  Consequently if a dependency is omitted but is needed, then the build will fail with a compile error.  \n\nI'm unaware of how to verify that the dependencies are the same version as those sitting in the lib folder, but we should be able to create a maven plugin that does something similar to that described in LUCENE-2657.  I'd say this test falls in the iterative category.\n\nbq. Poms have correct groupId and artifactId\nArtifacts for all modules are created\n\nThis can be handled through creating a test maven project which lists all the artifacts as dependencies with the expected groupId and artifactId.  Running the build for the test project would then fail if the dependencies don't exist (due to the artifactId or groupIds being incorrect specified, or because no artifact was made in the first place).\n\nbq. Artifacts match those created through the official ant build\n\nI sort of added this to correlate with Uwe's original request.  Maven will compile and jar the same source code as ant.  It will run the same tests (although I confess not with the same parallel magic as you made in ant).  Both maven and ant will use the same compiler.  Consequently the sources and compiled code included in the artifacts will be the same as produced by ant.   The only thing I can think of additionally checking here is the checksums match, but that will become complicated since maven includes its poms in its jars.  Maybe we could list the contents of the jars and compare? too pedantic maybe?\n\nMy point here is I think we can leverage Maven itself a great deal to test that its doing the right thing, or at least we are telling it to do the right thing.\n",

Problems include signing issues, syncing permissions and most importantly very bad documentation. These will be tackled in some other JIRA issues that'll spring up shortly, but I'll tackle this as well.",

It would be good to have an ant task that executes maven with a .pom file that requires all contrib/core artifacts (or one for each contrib) that \"downloads\" the artifacts from the local dist/maven folder and builds that test project. This would require maven to execute the build script. Also it should pass the ${version} ANT property to this pom.xml",
