Also converted one Arrays.asList(new Integer[0]) to Collections.emptyList()\n\nBut these are different right? specifically the first is mutable but the latter is immutable?\n{quote}\n\nHmm, I hadn't considered that.  Ordinarily I might argue that for a test of sorting an empty list, immutability is not a problem.\n\nHowever, LUCENE-2989 switched this exact line *away* from {{Collections.emptyList()}} to what it is now.\n\nSo in this version of the branch_3x patch I've reverted that change and added a comment pointing to LUCENE-2989.",

Can you add a comment, if not already there?",
