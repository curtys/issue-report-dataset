I will send my +1 once I tested and reviewed.\n\nOne thing:\n{code}\n+    assert format <= SegmentInfos.FORMAT_4_0;\n{code}\n\nIn my opinion, this should be a hard IndexFormatTooOldException (which is correct for someone who removed 3.x codec from his classpath). It *should* not happen, but for everything that comes from \"untrusted\" files on disk we should hard check those things. Otherwise maybe someone has a very strange codec configuration that enforces the 4.0 codec to read old indexes and does serious harm :-) This also makes migration to Lucene 5.0 easier. We have the version check already available, only 3.x codec needs to be removed and we are done.\n\nThis check also costs nothing, so we should *always ever* use hard checks when we read values from files, to detect errors early (of course, if it's to heavy we can use asserts).",

In general I am very sceptical with asserts in code that reads from disk.\n\nOne example: If we have code that reads a vInt withe the number of items in a list, then we read this number of items, followed by another vInt that has the length of the next list. Just asserting that this length is >0 is a bad idea, because if the length vInt is < 0, the file format is corrupt. And in that case a CorruptIndexException should be thrown. If we dont do this, a corrupt file could lead to unexpected behaviour. I did exactly that e.g. in the code parsing the Kumoroji dictionary targetMap, if the pointers in both arrays don't fit together, the file format is also corrupt. The complaint here was only, that asserts in code reading from disk should in most cases be hard checks, you never know what the file contains or what the hex editor of the user did.",
