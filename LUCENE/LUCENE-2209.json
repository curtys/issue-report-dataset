I'll pull together a proposed set of classes/methods that we should add @internal to.\n\nI think @expert is a different concept than @experimental, though, it may not warrant its own tag because merely putting \"Expert:\" in front of the javadocs seems OK?\n\nI would actually prefer bold, not red -- I think the red is overkill ;)  I like the current wording.",

The Javadoc compatibility contract is that future versions of javadoc won't add tags that have periods in their name so it's the way to avoid collisions (you should actauly see a warning about using a tag without a \".\" in it's name from javadoc when you declare these.\n\nSo i would suggest @lucene.internal, @lucene.expert, @lucene.experimental, etc...",
