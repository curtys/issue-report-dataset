    "description": "As pointed out in \nhttp://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=lucene-user@jakarta.apache.org&msgNo=11034\nthe documentation of FilteredTermEnum.term() is wrong:\nit says \n'Returns the current Term in the enumeration. Initially invalid, valid after\nnext() called for the first time.'\nbut the implementation of the constructors of the two derived classes\n(FuzzyTermEnum and WildcardTermEnum) already initializes the object to point to\nthe first match. So calling next() before accessing terms will leave out the\nfirst match.\n\nSo I suggest to replace the second sentance by something like\n'Returns null if no Term matches or all terms have been enumerated.'\n(I checked that for WildcardTermEnum only).\nFurther one might add some note to the docs of the constructors of FuzzyTermEnum\nand WildcardTermEnum that they will point to the first element of the\nenumeration (if any).",
