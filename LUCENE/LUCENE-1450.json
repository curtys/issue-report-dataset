    "description": "The constructor for RangeTermEnum initializes a TermEnum starting with lowerTermText, but when a collator is defined, all terms in the given field need to be checked, since collation can introduce non-Unicode orderings.  Instead, the RangeTermEnum constructor should test for a non-null collator, and if there is one, point the TermEnum at the first term in the given field.\n\nLUCENE-1424 introduced this bug.",
