    "description": "HTMLParser.java contains this code: \n \n  public HTMLParser(File file) throws FileNotFoundException { \n    this(new FileInputStream(file)); \n  } \n \nThis FileInputStream should be closed with the close() method, as there's no \nguarantee that the garbage collection will run and do this for you. I don't \nknow how to fix this without changing the API to take a FileInputStream \ninstead of a File, as the call to this() must be the first thing in the \nconstructor, i.e. you cannot create the stream, call this(...), and then close \nthe stream.",
