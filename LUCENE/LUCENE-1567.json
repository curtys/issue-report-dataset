We are working on a patch which we will upload to this JIRA soon, it will only be for the community to review the new query parser code and not to be committed against the trunk. I think somebody could create a sandbox and commit the code, it would be easier for other to review the new query parser.\n\nI think the right question is if we should include this new parser in the release 2.9, if yes, then we definitely need to change the code to be java 1.4 compatible. Anyway, before taking this decision, the code must be available for the community : )\n\nBest Regards,",

All the generics would be removed. I don't see any back compatibility problem if we add generics in future, we could hardcode the type checking if we release with 1.4 and any user impl of this class will need to do the same and follow the documentation.\n\nModifierQueryNode has an enum called Modifier with values MOD_NOT, MOD_NONE and MOD_REQ. An enum can be almost completely reproduced on 1.4 using: \n\n...\nfinal public static class Modifier implements Serializable {\n\n   final public static Modifier MOD_NOT = new Modifier();\n\n   final public static Modifier MOD_NOT = new Modifier();\n\n   final public static Modifier MOD_NOT = new Modifier();\n\n   private Modifier() { // empty constructor }\n\n   // we might add some Enum methods, like name(), etc...\n\n}\n...\n\nThe only back compatibility problem I see when we change the Modifier to enum again is if on the version 1.4 the user checks for Modifier.class.isEnum()...does anybody see any other back-compatibility issue?\n\nThe last thing that will need to be changed is on the QueryBuilder and LuceneQueryBuilder. The QueryBuilder.build() returns an Object and when LuceneQueryBuilder implements it, it specializes the return to Query, which will start throwing Object instead if we change to 1.4. On this case I don't see any back-compatibility issue also.\n\nRegarding the new QP framework, I don't see any problem about back compatibility, because Lucene will only be Java 1.5 on version 3.0, and back compatibility may be broken. But...\n\nI would see nothing wrong with having a jdk 1.4 version if we were 100% compatible with the old queryparser,\nbut since that is not the case, I don't think it is worth it. (the wrapper we built does not support the case where users extend the old queryparser class and overwrite methods to add new functionality)\n\nI agree with Luis, if we only release the new QP framework 2.9, we will definitely brake the back-compatiblity of the old QP, so, why not release the old and the new QP together on 2.9?\n\nSuggestions? :)\n\nBest Regards,\nAdriano Crestani Campos\nAdriano Crestani Campos",

I was thinking about a class that would allow query parser implementors to \"bundle\" their processor, text parser and builder in it, so the user could simply use it, nobody needs to know how it's implemented.

I will keep reviewing and improving the documentation, I think there might be some broken javadoc links yet.\n\nI also would like to rename the package and everythiing else that does reference to \"lucene2\" to \"lucene\". I think it does not make sense to have a package name tied to a version. So, the package org.apache.lucene.queryParser.lucene2 would be renamed to org.apache.lucene.queryParser.lucene. I know it's kind of weird, because there are 2 \"lucene\" in the package declararion, but I think it's better than \"lucene2\". Anyway, suggestions about this are welcome :) ... if nobody replies I will feel free to rename it and submit a new patch soon.\n\nI will also work on writing a documentation for Lucene wiki that explains how to easily migrate from the old query parser to the new one, but I will only add it to the wiki when the code is committed to the trunk, it doesn't make sense a wiki documentation about something that is not even committed, agreed?\n\nSuggestions?\n\nRegards,\nAdriano Crestani Campos",

How are we going to migrate the subclasses we have to the current queryParser (ComplexPhraseQueryParser and MultiFieldQueryParser) to the new queryParser?\n\nHere's the answer to 1/2 of my question: the current patch already contains a MultiFieldQueryParserWrapper.  It too is deprecated, which means in the move to core that we'll do for 3.0, it'll be removed.  But the migration path forward seems quite simple: use a MultiFieldQueryNodeProcessor to rewrite all queries so they are against multiple fields (I think?).  If that's right, can you update the deprecated javadocs explaining that this is the way forward?  In general when we deprecate the old, we need to point the way to the new.\n\nAlso, can you fix all indentation to 2-space in the next patch iteration?\n\nI'm not sure exactly how, but it'd be great if this new QueryParser had better integration with NumericRangeQuery.  But that's a nice-to-have for 2.9.",

    "description": "From \"New flexible query parser\" thread by Micheal Busch\n\nin my team at IBM we have used a different query parser than Lucene's in\nour products for quite a while. Recently we spent a significant amount\nof time in refactoring the code and designing a very generic\narchitecture, so that this query parser can be easily used for different\nproducts with varying query syntaxes.\n\nThis work was originally driven by Andreas Neumann (who, however, left\nour team); most of the code was written by Luis Alves, who has been a\nbit active in Lucene in the past, and Adriano Campos, who joined our\nteam at IBM half a year ago. Adriano is Apache committer and PMC member\non the Tuscany project and getting familiar with Lucene now too.\n\nWe think this code is much more flexible and extensible than the current\nLucene query parser, and would therefore like to contribute it to\nLucene. I'd like to give a very brief architecture overview here,\nAdriano and Luis can then answer more detailed questions as they're much\nmore familiar with the code than I am.\nThe goal was it to separate syntax and semantics of a query. E.g. 'a AND\nb', '+a +b', 'AND(a,b)' could be different syntaxes for the same query.\nWe distinguish the semantics of the different query components, e.g.\nwhether and how to tokenize/lemmatize/normalize the different terms or\nwhich Query objects to create for the terms. We wanted to be able to\nwrite a parser with a new syntax, while reusing the underlying\nsemantics, as quickly as possible.\nIn fact, Adriano is currently working on a 100% Lucene-syntax compatible\nimplementation to make it easy for people who are using Lucene's query\nparser to switch.\n\nThe query parser has three layers and its core is what we call the\nQueryNodeTree. It is a tree that initially represents the syntax of the\noriginal query, e.g. for 'a AND b':\n  AND\n /   \\\nA     B\n\nThe three layers are:\n1. QueryParser\n2. QueryNodeProcessor\n3. QueryBuilder\n\n1. The upper layer is the parsing layer which simply transforms the\nquery text string into a QueryNodeTree. Currently our implementations of\nthis layer use javacc.\n2. The query node processors do most of the work. It is in fact a\nconfigurable chain of processors. Each processors can walk the tree and\nmodify nodes or even the tree's structure. That makes it possible to\ne.g. do query optimization before the query is executed or to tokenize\nterms.\n3. The third layer is also a configurable chain of builders, which\ntransform the QueryNodeTree into Lucene Query objects.\n\nFurthermore the query parser uses flexible configuration objects, which\nare based on AttributeSource/Attribute. It also uses message classes that\nallow to attach resource bundles. This makes it possible to translate\nmessages, which is an important feature of a query parser.\n\nThis design allows us to develop different query syntaxes very quickly.\nAdriano wrote the Lucene-compatible syntax in a matter of hours, and the\nunderlying processors and builders in a few days. We now have a 100%\ncompatible Lucene query parser, which means the syntax is identical and\nall query parser test cases pass on the new one too using a wrapper.\n\n\nRecent posts show that there is demand for query syntax improvements,\ne.g improved range query syntax or operator precedence. There are\nalready different QP implementations in Lucene+contrib, however I think\nwe did not keep them all up to date and in sync. This is not too\nsurprising, because usually when fixes and changes are made to the main\nquery parser, people don't make the corresponding changes in the contrib\nparsers. (I'm guilty here too)\nWith this new architecture it will be much easier to maintain different\nquery syntaxes, as the actual code for the first layer is not very much.\nAll syntaxes would benefit from patches and improvements we make to the\nunderlying layers, which will make supporting different syntaxes much\nmore manageable.\n",
