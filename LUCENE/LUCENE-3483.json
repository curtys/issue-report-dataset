As a result of that I needed to make two explicit changes:\n* Changed visibility of SentinelIntSet from package protected to public.\n* Minor documentation change in package.html\n\nI could have moved SentinelIntSet to term package instead of changing visibility, but now other users can use this class as well now. Maybe one day SentinelIntSet can move to core in a util package. ",
