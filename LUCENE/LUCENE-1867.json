(i had to bloat it 200KB more with \"Misc Data\" for it to actually work, sorry)\nit is still much smaller, 3,660,340 bytes versus 5,647,316 bytes... almost 2MB savings\n\ni did feel it was best to rename the jar file to icu4j-collation-4.0.jar\nThis way its not mistaken for a \"full\" icu4j\n\nNo script changes are necessary, as it is referenced as:\n{noformat}\n  <path id=\"additional.dependencies\">\n    <fileset dir=\"lib\" includes=\"icu4j-*.jar\"/>\n{noformat}\n\nI compiled this jar with the latest JDK 1.4, and all the tests pass.\n",
