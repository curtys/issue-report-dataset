            "body": "Whileworking on this, i fixed a few general issues with the way some contribs could be built/tested easily from their own directory, but not as part of hte larger \"build-contrib\" \"test-contrib\" targets, items included in this patch...\n\n1) change the main \"test\" target to \"test-core\" and add a new \"test\" target which depends on test and test-contrib\n2) change \"test.classpath\" reference to include core test classes (which some contrib test classes have compile dependencies on)\n3) make xml-query-parser's dependency on the queries contrib more standardized so the queries jar is forcably built no matter how xml-query-parser is built\n4) fix MemoryIndexTest so it can find the input files it's looking at regardless of what directory the test is run from.\n5) make the generate-test-reports target work both for individual contribs as well as for hte project as a whole\n6) make contrib-crawl fail by default if the target fails for any of the contribs (so build-contrib now fails immediately if a contrib fails to build)\n7) make test-contrib delay any failure until all contribs have been tested -- this makes it possible to run \"ant generate-test-reports\" after a failed \"ant test\" and see all of the failures.\n\nNote that i only modified contribs in cases where they had problems related to their expectations about being built or tested in a specific directory ... as it stands there are still some test errors/failures...\n\n  #a) TestPrecedenceQueryParser has 3 failures\n  #b) spellchecker has one test failure (i believe there is already a patch in another issue)\n  #c) contrib/db/bdb has dependencies on a native library\n\n#a and #b are related to functionality ... i have no qualms about them being broken and preventing builds until decisisons are made about how to fix them correctly.\n\n#c on the other hand raises some interesting questions: should we skip those tests unless the native library is present? ... i'm not even sure how to do that (<available> on a classpath resource i understand, java.library.path i don't).  Are committers preparing official releases expected to have those native libraries in order to sign off on the build?  \n\n\nI'm happy to commit this as is and let the nightly builds be broken until we deal with this ... but it would be nice if at least one other person could try it out an verify that it works for them as well.\n",

There are still some\n  failing tests, as some were added to show expectations not yet met. The\n  main missing piece is getting NOT precedence accounted for.\"\n\nand\n\n  \"move PrecedenceQueryParser to contrib/misc until the kinks are \n  worked out\"\n  \nBoth comments are from early 2005.
