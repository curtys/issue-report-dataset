I'll wait a few days to see if others have comments though.\n\nI think there might be a thread safety issue with your patch: you use an unsynchronized fail-fast iterator in RAMDirectory.sizeInBytes().   I think using an Enumerator here should work, right?\n\nToo bad there doesn't seem to be an easy way to incrementally maintain sizeInBytes... waking over the whole Hashtable for each document addition isn't pretty for large maxBufferedDocs, esp if the number of indexed fields is large.  At least this only affects people using this functionallity though.",

That might not be sufficient for total thread safety though.\n\nenumerating through the Hashtable while not synchronized means you can encounter an object that was just added by another thread.  The other thread synchronized while adding the new object, but the thread enumerating didn't execute a read barrier.  The new memory model provides \"out-of-thin-air safety\" and \"initialization safety\" guarantees.  Thus, we are guaranteed to see a complete instance of RAMFile (just not necessarily current).  In this specific usecase, I think it boils down to if updating the long length is atomic, which we can't guarantee for all platforms.  Your count could be off by 4GB if you \"see\" the bottom 32 bits before the top.\n\nIn this IndexWriter usecase, we should never see a long length that uses both 32 bit words, because we are talking about single segments though.\n\nBottom line (I think):  If you want getSizeBytes to work correctly 100% of the time in *all* instances and platforms, you need to synchronize it (and hence block any gets/puts during that time.... blech)\n\n",

Hashtable.values() tracks all changes to the ram directory as they occur.  The fail-fast iterator does not accept concurrent modificaitons.  So, the answer is to stop concurrent modifications during sizeInBytes().  This is accomplised by synchronizing on the same objects as the modificaitons already use, i.e. files.  I'm attaching a new version of the the patch that I believe is correct.\n\nPlease emabarass me again if there is another mistake!\n",

In the unsynchronized case, you don't know if the size will include the new file or not.   If sizeInBytes() is synchronized, you still don't know which thread will acquire the lock first, so you still don't know if the size will include the new file.  Synchronizing sizeInBytes() does nothing but add a bottleneck.\n\n> Synchronizing on files avoids the problem altogether without much cost as the loop is fast. \n\nI disagree that the loop will be fast... simpler loops have proven to take some time:\n  LUCENE-388: Improve indexing performance when maxBufferedDocs is\n  large by keeping a count of buffered documents rather than\n  counting after each document addition.\nThat was just counting the documents, not the number of files in each segment (which will be larger).\nConsider maxBufferedDocs of 1000 to 10000 with 10 or 20 indexed fields, and you end up with 17000 to 270000 files to calculate the size over.\n",

Incremental management of the size seems most important, especially considering that this will also eliminate the cost of the synchronization.\n\nI still think the syncrhonization adds safety since it guarantees that the loop sees a state of the directory that did exist at some time.  At that time, the directory did have the reported size.  Without the synchronization the loop may compute a size for a set of files that never comprised the contents of the directory at any instant.  Consider this case:\n\n  1.  Thread 1 adds a new document, creating a new segment with new index files, leading to segment merging, that creates new larger segment index files, and then deletes all replaced segment index files.  Thread 1 then adds a second document, creating new segment index files.\n  2.  Thread 2 is computing sizeInBytes and happens to see a state where all the new files from both the first and second documents are added, but the deletions are not seen.  This could happen if the deleted files happen to be earlier in the hash array than the added files for either document.\n\nIn this case sizeInBytes() without the synchronization computes a larger size for the directory than ever actually existed.\n\nRe. RAMDIrectory.fileLength(), it is not used within Lucene at all, but it is public, and the restriction that is not valid when index operations are happening concurrently is not specified.

Yonik's comment about my synchronization scenario.  Synhronizing as described does resolve the issue.  No higher level synchronization is requried.  It doesn't matter how concurent operations on the directory are ordered or intereleaved, so long as any computation that does a loop sees some instance of the directory that corresponds to its actual content at any polnt in time.  The result of the loop will then be accurate for that instant.\n\n2.  Lucene has this same syncrhonization bug today in RAMDIrectory.list().  It can return a list of files that never comprised the contents of the directory.  This is fixed in the attached.\n\n3.  Also, the long synchronization bug exists in RAMDirectory.fileModified() as well as RAMDIrectory.fileLength() since both are public.  These are fixed in the attached.\n\n4.  I moved the synchronization off of the Hashtable (replacing it with a HashMap) up to the RAMDirectory as there are some operations that require synchronization at the directory level.  Using just one lock seems better.  As all Hashtable operations were already synchonized, I don't believe any material additional synchronization is added.\n\n5.  Lucene currently make the assumption that if a file is being written by a stream then no other streams are simultaneously reading or writing it.  I've maintained this assumption as an optimization, allowing the streams to access fields directly without syncrhonization.  This is documented in the comments, as is the locking order.\n\n5.  sizeInBytes is now maintained incrementally, efficiently.\n\n6.  Yonik, your version (which I just now saw) has a bug in RAMDIrectory.renameFile().  The to file may already exist, in which case it is overwritten and it's size must be subtracted.  I actually hit this in my test case for my implementation and fixed it (since Lucene renames a new version of the segments file).\n\nAll Lucene tests, including the new test, pass.  Some contrib tests fail, I believe none of these failures are in any way related to this patch.\n\n\n",

The size after the merge before the deletes really is that big!  This is what I mean by any computation involving a loop is accurate at that instant.  Without the synchronization, you can get a result that was *never* accurate, i.e. represents a file set that never existed.  For a size computation, that result could be larger or smaller than any actual size the directory ever attained.  That is the point of my example.  For a list() computaiton with an unprotected loop (as in lucene now) you can set a set of files that were never the contents of the directory at any instant.\n\nNo higher level synchronization is required to achieve the semantics that a looping computaiton is accurate at the instant it is performed.  Without directory (or files Hashtable) syncrhonization protecting the whole loop, the result can be random, having no correlation to any actual state the directory ever attained.\n\n> Anyway, I think the point is moot as I think we should handle the size incrementally. \n\nNot quite, because the bug already exists in lucene in RAMDirectory.list().
