I ran a test where I index the first 6M docs from\nWikipedia preprocessed to 100 bytes each, using this alg:\n\n{code}\n  analyzer=org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard.StandardAnalyzer\n  doc.maker=org.apache.lucene.benchmark.byTask.feeds.LineDocMaker\n  work.dir=/lucene/work\n  doc.stored = true\n  doc.term.vector = true\n  doc.term.vector.positions = true\n  doc.term.vector.offsets = true\n  ram.flush.mb = 64\n  compound = false\n  autocommit = false\n  docs.file=/Volumes/External/lucene/wikifull100.txt\n  doc.add.log.step=10000\n  \n  directory=FSDirectory\n  \n  ResetSystemErase\n  { \"BuildIndex\"\n    CreateIndex\n    [ { \"AddDocs\" AddDoc > : 1500000 ]: 4\n    CloseIndex\n  }\n  \n  RepSumByPrefRound BuildIndex\n{code}\n\nWith this fix, it takes 158.5 seconds.  Without it, it takes 621.8\nseconds = 3.9X slower!\n\nThe fix is very low risk.  All tests pass.\n\nMichael, I think we should spin 2.3 RC2 to include this fix?  Sorry to\nonly find it so late in the game :(\n",

And after reading the\npatch I agree that it looks good and is low risk.\n\n{quote}\nMichael, I think we should spin 2.3 RC2 to include this fix? Sorry to\nonly find it so late in the game \n{quote}\n\nOK, why don't you commit this today. Meanwhile I'll look into the\nsmall issues Hoss pointed out and then build RC2 end of today.\n\nOh, and no need to be sorry! This is what the code freeze period is\nfor - finding and fixing problems! :-)",

    "description": "I've been doing some \"final\" performance testing of 2.3RC1 and\nuncovered a fairly serious bug that adds a large fixed CPU cost when\ndocuments have any term vector enabled fields.\n\nThe bug does not affect correctness, just performance.\n\nBasically, for every document, we were calling Arrays.fill(0) on a\nlarge (32 KB) byte array when in fact we only needed to zero a small\npart of it.  This only happens if term vectors are turned on, and is\nespecially devastating for small documents.",
