The above patch was applied in kernel 2.6.29, and causes SEQUENTIAL to act like NOREUSE, and so we should use SEQUENTIAL for merging but not for searching, I think?  We should experiment and see...\n\nReally, for searching we want the \"old\" SEQUENTIAL behavior (ie, do aggressive readahead, but use the normal eviction policy since that term may be searched on again).\n\nHopefully NativeUnixDir will take care of all these os/kernel-version dependent flags for you.",

I fixed those...\n\nI also changed NativeUnixDir to take a delegate Dir which we fall back\nto when we don't want to use direct IO; this enabled removing of\nopen_normal since we just use the \"normal\" java Dir impls for this.\n\nTo run all tests on Linux I do this:\n{noformat}\nexport CLASSPATH=/lucene/unixdir/lucene/build/contrib/misc/lucene-misc-4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lucene/unixdir/lucene/build/native:/usr/local/lib\nant test-core -Dtests.directory=NativeUnixDirectory\n{noformat}\n\n(Change the path to your full path... or maybe use relative path but\nthat could be dangerous since tests may change the CWD... not sure).\n\nIt also requires a temporary ctor in the directory taking only File\nand using FSDirectory.open for the delegate directory.\n\nFinally I added another setting, minBytesDirect: if the file to open\n(in openInput), or expected merge size (in createOutput), is smaller\nthan this, then we don't use direct IO.\n\nTo test this... I temporarily fixed the dir to always use direct IO,\nand tests (eventually: ~75 minutes!) passed, except for some Solr tests which look\nlike timeout problems.  I temporarily dropped the default\nbuffer size to 4 KB (from 256 KB) else the JVM ran out of direct\nbuffer space.\n\nI'll test on OS X as well...\n",
