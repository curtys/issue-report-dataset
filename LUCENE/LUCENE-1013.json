    "description": "Yonik hit this (see details in LUCENE-994): because we have switched\nto LogByteSizeMergePolicy by default in IndexWriter, which uses MB to\nlimit max size of merges (setMaxMergeMB), when an existing app calls\nsetMaxMergeDocs (or getMaxMergeDocs) it will hit an\nIllegalArgumentException on dropping in the new JAR.\n\nI think the simplest solution is to fix LogByteSizeMergePolicy to\nallow setting of the max by either MB or by doc count, just like how\nin LUCENE-1007 allows flushing by either MB or docCount or both.",
