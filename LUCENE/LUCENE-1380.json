The option thus should be named something like \"coterminalPositionIncrement\".  This seems like a reasonable addition, and a patch likely would be accepted, if it included unit tests.\n{quote}\n\nYou have used the option name I suggested, but have implemented it in a form that doesn't follow the name -- in your implementation, *all* tokens are placed at the same position, not just those that start at the same word -- and I think this form is inappropriate for the general user.\n\nI'm -1 on the patch in its current form.  If rewritten to modify the position increment only for those shingles that begin at the same word, I'd be +1 (assuming it works and is tested appropriately).",

If rewritten to modify the position increment only for those shingles that begin at the same word, I'd be +1 (assuming it works and is tested appropriately).\n\nAs i said in thread your suggestion does not work.\nSetting each shingle to have a positionIncrement=1 so to avoid using the MultiPhraseQuery in favour of the plain PhraseQuery makes sense, but does not work. And not phrasing the query doesn't invoke the ShingleFilter properly.\n\n> The ShingleFilter appears to only work, at least for me, on phrases.\n> I would think this correct as each shingle is in fact a sub-phrase to the larger original phrase.\n\nIf this is the case, ie ShingleFilter works on phrases as a whole entity, and that shingles from each term in the phrase do have a relationship as they all come from the one phrase, then does it not make sense to have the possibility to position them altogether.\n\nFor example in the current implementation, in the phrase \"abcd efgh ijkl\" it is the first term \"abcd\" that is responsible for generating the shingles \"abcd efgh ijkl\" and \"abcd efgh\". \nWhat  says that these shingles couldn't be generated from the \"efgh\" (or \"ijkl\" for the former shingle) term in an alternative implementation?\nWhy the presumption that it's in the user's interest to force this separation between where this implementation chooses to put its shingles?\n\nIf this isn't lost-in-the-bush-logic, have you a suggestion for a more appropriate option name for the current solution?",

Your PositionFilter tests looks at offsets, which PositionFilter doesn't affect at all.  It is possible that PositionFilter will be used for other things than ShingleFilter.  Hence, there should be basic test(s) that evaluate PositionFilter without ShingleFilter.\n\nI also think a test to make sure a single instance of PositionFilter will work with multiple documents should be added.\n\nBTW, you don't need to delete JIRA attachments if you want to upload a new version - when you upload a same-named file, the most recent version of the file will be colored black, and older versions will be colored gray.

In fact, the proper response from a filter in the analysis chain upon encountering null is to stop processing, since it means end-of-stream, so I've removed your tests with null embedded in this revised patch.\n\nbq. Steve, can you look at the reset versus null token in stream difference. Are both approaches valid to test?

In its place I've added another test named testReset().\n\nI added a test that checks for non-default positionIncrement: testNonZeroPositionIncrement().\n\nI removed PositionFilter.setPositionIncrement(), because using it one could potentially change the position increment in mid-stream, which makes little sense.  The alternate constructor provides a way to set it.\n\nIn the patch, I have modified the formatting a little to conform to Lucene convention, which is outlined on the [HowToContribute wiki page|http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/HowToContribute#head-59ae13df098fbdcc46abdf980aa8ee76d3ee2e3b]:\n\n{quote}\n* Code should be formatted according to [Sun's conventions|http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/] with one exception:\n** indent two spaces per level, not four.\n{quote}\n\nI ran \"svn diff\" under the trunk/ directory, instead of in trunk/contrib/analyzers/ (where you based your patches) - it's simpler for people who look at a lot of these things to have them always be based from trunk/.\n\nTake a look and make sure things are as they should be - the tests pass for me, and I think it's doing what it should do.\n\nIf you agree, then hopefully we can get Karl (or another committer, which I'm not) to take a look and see if they think it can be committed.\n",
