    "description": "FSDirectory.close implements logic to ensure only a single instance of FSDirectory per canonical directory exists.  This means code that synchronizes on the FSDirectory instance is also synchronized against that canonical directory.  I think only IndexModifier (now deprecated) actually makes use of this, but I'm not certain. \n\nBut, the close() method doesn't detect double close, and doesn't catch usage after being closed, and so one can easily get two instances of FSDirectory for the same canonical directory.",
