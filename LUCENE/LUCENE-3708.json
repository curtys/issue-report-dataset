Not called  when the field omits term\n   *  freq and positions. */\n   public abstract void finishDoc() throws IOException;\n{noformat}\n\nBut this is confusing (because a field can omit just positions, is it called then?!),\nand wrong (because merging calls it always, even if freq+positions is omitted).\n\nI think we should fix the javadoc and fix FreqProxTermsWriter to always call finish()\n",
