Or, maybe to DocValues instead...\n\nToday neither DocValues nor FieldCache use an FST to hold the term data, but you're right we could explore this now, since we can lookup-by-ord or lookup-by-address (with this patch).\n\nFor example, the DocValues.BYTES_VAR/FIXED_SORTED_DEREF could hold the Term <-> ord/address map as an FST (doc -> ord/address would still be packed ints)... same for FieldCache.DocTermsIndex/.DocTermOrds This should be a sizable reduction in RAM required for the term data... but lookup time would get slower too.\n",

It was almost a year ago so perhaps you forgot.  Well this JIRA issue would be the first step, the next step would be another JIRA issue for Field Cache integration and another for DocValues.  I feel a tad guilty for suggesting this work without taking part... I'm neck deep in geospatial Lucene extensions.",

Thanks for reminding me :)  I think it would work well... the FST should compress the terms nicely; just a question of at what cost to lookup time.  But, then, for some cases of DV/FC consumption the doc -> ord lookup is far more important (which wouldn't change), so it could be a good win...",
