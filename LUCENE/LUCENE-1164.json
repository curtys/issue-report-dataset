    "description": "CMS now lets you set \"maxMergeThreads\" to control max # simultaneous\nmerges.\n\nHowever, when CMS hits that max, it still allows further merges to\nrun, by running them in the foreground thread.  So if you set this max\nto 1, and use 1 thread to add docs, you can get 2 merges running at\nonce (which I think is broken).\n\nI think, instead, CMS should pause the foreground thread, waiting\nuntil the number of merge threads drops below the limit.  Then, kick\noff the backlog merge in a thread and return control back to primary\nthread.\n",
