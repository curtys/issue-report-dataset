            "body": "Attached sloppy_phrase_java.patch.txt is fixing the failing new tests. \nThis also includes the skipTo() bug from issue 697.\n\nThe fix does not guarantee that document A B C B A would score \"A B C\"~4 and \"C B A\"~4 the same. \nIt does that for \"B C\"~2 and \"C B\"~2.\nThis is because a general fix for that (at least the one that I devised) would be too expensive.\nAlthough this is an interesting case, I'd like to think it is not an important one.\n\nThis fix comes with a performance cost:  about 15% degradation in CPU activity of sloppy phrase scoring, as the attcahed perf logs show.\nHere is the summary of these tests:\n\n.......Operation..........runCnt...recsPerRun.....rec/s..elapsedSec\nOrig:..SearchSameRdr_3000......4.........3000.....216.1.......55.52\nNew:...SearchSameRdr_3000......4.........3000.....187.8.......63.91\n\nI think that in a real life scenario - real index, real documents, real queries - this extra CPU will be shaded by IO, but I also belive we should refrain from slowing down search, so, unhappy with this degradation (anyone would:-), I would look for a other ways to fix this - ideas are welcome.\n\nPerf test was done using the task benchmark framework (see issue 675), The logs show also the queries that were searched.\n\nAll tests pass with new code.",

Some of the asserts in the new tests were commented out cause the patch takes decision not to fix case 1 above.\n\nAlso attaching the updates perf test logs - res-search-orig2.log and res-search-new2.log.\n\nI did not compare scoring of similar cases between sloppy phrase and near spans and Paul suggested - perhaps next week - not sure this should hold progress with this issue.",
