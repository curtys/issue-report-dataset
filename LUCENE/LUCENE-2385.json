Also includes the relevant changes to benchmark (algorithms + CreateIndexTask).\nI've fixed a typo I had in NoMergeScheduler - not related to this issue, but since it was just a typo, thought it's no harm to do it here.\n\nTests pass. Planning to commit shortly.",

            "body": "I did that first, but then remembered that when I did that in the past, people were unable to apply my patches, w/o doing the svn move themselves. Anyway, for this file it's not really important I think - a very simple and tiny file, w/ no history to preserve? Is that ok for this file (b/c I have no idea how to do the svn move now ... after I've made all the changes already) :)",

If you paste those commands into your terminal and then apply the patch, it works. One example is the jflex issue (ok, the commands are shortened).\n\nAnother possibility is to have a second checkout, where you arrange the files correctly (svn moved/copied) and one for creating the patches.",
