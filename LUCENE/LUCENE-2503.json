            "body": "bq. Man are you fast!\n\nnot really, i've been working it for a while but since someone asked i figure i would create the issue.\ntesting isnt done, but english, french, portuguese I think are ok.\nthe others need a lot of tests and probably have bugs.\n\nbq. Does the English one deal with women/ woman and foci / focus type stuff?\n\nNope, the english one is the Harman \"s-stemming\" algorithm.\n\nits very simple:\n{noformat}\nif final is '-ies' but not '-eies' or '-aies' then\nreplace '-ies' by '-y', return;\nif final is '-es' but not '-aes', '-ees' or '-oes' then\nreplace '-es' by '-e', return;\nif final is '-s' but not '-us' or '-ss' then\nremove '-s';\nreturn.\n{noformat}\n\nFor special cases like you mentioned (if you want them), i would recommend adding these customizations yourself\nas documented here: http://wiki.apache.org/solr/LanguageAnalysis#Customizing_Stemming\n\njust make a tab-separated file of words-stems and put a StemmerOverrideFilter(Factory) before the stemmer in the stream.\n\nI think this alone provides a lot of flexibility. if it isn't enough, then i think these stemmers are much simpler to modify if you wanted to go that route also :)\n",
