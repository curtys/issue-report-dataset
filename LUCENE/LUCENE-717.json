I'm not talking about the ANT_HOME/lib, I'm talking about the \"lib\" directory directly under the root directory you get when checking out hte lucene \"trunk\" ... \n\n        http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/lucene/java/trunk/lib/\n\n...it's empty, and doesn't get included in the source tar balls, but the junit.classpath refrences it, so the build fails if it doesn't exist.\n\nwe should either eliminate it if it's not needed, or include it in the tar balls if we want to leave it as a placeholder for things that may come in the future.",
