I figured that if we implement a factory with the basic codePointAt method based on a version we can implement the most of the algorithms / methods just by obtaining the version correspondent instance of CharacterUtils (new class I introduced) What this class does is pretty simple - if version >= 3.1 it delegates to the Character correspondent while for earlier versions it convert a character to a codepoint without checking the for high surrogates. Once we have done this conversion we can simply use all the Character.*(int) methods as they are.\n\n",
