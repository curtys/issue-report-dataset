Its not horribly off, but its off, and their are some tasks it doesn't list.\n\nRelating to this issue, it also still mentions: doc.tokenize.log.step, which is no longer used. Not fixed in my patch, but should this now be: log.step.ReadTokens ? I'm not sure offhand what used to use that log name.",

Since we document log.step.[class] above it, I saw no reason to keep it there.",

The .alg file will support:\n* log.step - for all tasks.\n* log.step.<Task Class Name> - for a specific task. For example, log.step.AddDoc, or log.step.DeleteDoc\n\nI will post the patch soon",
