In fact, I've investigated and was about to open an issue before I came across this one :).\n\nW/ Flex, one can set a Codec, however that Codec will be used for regular segment merges. The problem (that I've run into and you describe here) is that during addIndexes*, one would need a different Codec for payloads, in order to rewrite the ones that come from the external indexes. I was thinking to add another variation of addIndexes* which take a PayloadConsumer as input, and in SM.appendPostings, after it reads the payload from the other index, invoke PayloadConsumer on that payload, and only after that write it to PositionConsumer.\n\nThat API would of course be marked as experimental.\n\nAlso, SM.appendPostings is called from two different code paths - addIndexes* and regular segment merges. For the regular merges, the PC should be null, but for the addIndexes it may not be. So we'll need to add that API to a bunch of classes in the call chain, but all of them are either private methods or package-private classes.\n\nHow's that sound? I can cons up a patch if that sounds reasonable.",

            "body": "I went over the tests and realized I didn't write one which adds indexes into an already populated index. Ideally, the payloads in the existing index should not be re-processed b/c of the external ones that are added. But this doesn't happen, as addIndexes and addIndexesNoOpt don't distinguish well between local and external segments. It all boils down to IW,merge() which calls SM.merge() ...\nThen I figured a single PayloadConsumer \"might not fit all\" - e.g. there are cases where different PCs are needed for different indexes. The app can call addIndexes one at a time, but that's not efficient. So I think the entry-level API should be a PayloadConsumerProvider, which declares one getPayloadConsumer(Directory) method. It returns a PC corresponding to a Directory. It gives the app the freedom it needs to:\n* Always return the same PC for all Dirs.\n* Return different PCs for different Dirs.\n* Return null for some Dirs, so that their payloads are not re-processed.\n\nSetting out to impl that, I've noticed addIndexes and addIndexesNoOpt behave differently. While addIndexes interacts w/ the SegmentMerger directly (and hence can easily pass it the PCP), NoOpt reads the SIs from the given Dirs, call maybeMerge(), which triggers SM.merge(), to merge local + external segments. We cannot pass PCP to maybeMerge since that won't help - the call chain hits MergeScheduler, which loops-back at us when it calls IW.merge() .. seems way too complicated.\nAdditionally, there is no way to guarantee that PCP won't be invoked during addIndexesNoOpt on local segments (unless it does not provide a PC for the target Dir) ...\n\nTherefore, I'd like to add PCP to IWC, for the following reasons:\n* As I said above, there's no way to guarantee it won't be invoked on local segments when *NoOpt is called.\n* There's no clean way to ensure NoOpt passes it on to SM, w/o passing PCP through MergeScheduler.\n* It might be useful for apps that want to rewrite their payloads only over time -- sort of a mini app-level migration tool (of just payloads).\n* It cleans the API - does not affect 'backwards', no need to pass it on through several methods until it gets to SM -- simplifies the solution.\n\nThis is an expert API. Therefore, apps that set it probably know what they're doing. Therefore I believe they will be able to understand how to not invoke their PCs on the target dir's segments.\n\nWhat do you think?",

We cannot process all the payloads in the index the same way. So how about the following:\n* PayloadProcessorProvider will accept both a Directory and a Term, and will return a suitable PayloadProcessor for that Directory, and if needed, for the Directory+Term combination.\n* PayloadProcessor will continue to work as is and will expose the same API - a payload is still a payload. Its the responsibility of PPP to return the right PP instance for the given Dir+Term\nIt does not make sense that the payloads of all the terms in the incoming indexes will need to be processed. Specifically, the scenario I have at hand needs to rewrite payloads of certain postings only, but the index contains payloads in other postings as well.\n\nFor 3x that's easy - SMI holds the current Term that is processed. But I don't see an equivalent in trunk, in PostingsConsumer. It receives a DocsEnum which does not tell you the term it works on, and MergeState which includes just FieldInfo, which can tell you the field name? Any ideas how I can get the Term this posting belongs to? (I know there is no Term, but field + BytesRef will do).\n\nMike - I'll add PP as a required arg to SM, np.

Some will return the same PP for all terms, but maybe different ones per directory, while others will only care about few terms, returning null for all the rest.

Strangely, flex allows stateless PPs mor easily b/c it uses BytesRef, while in 3x one needs to call both process and payloadLength() and hence concurrency is more a problem.\n\nI believe the common use will be few PPs that handle few terms. Of course once this is out, people will find original uses for it :). But for now, I don't see a big perf hit...\n\nabout performance, we're checking for every position and doc whether the processor is not null. I guess it is better than having a no-op processor?

PPP works w/ Directory+Term because the format of the payloads is per term for the entire Directory (not per segment). Therefore, I don't think there is multi-threading issues with the external Directories (the result of addIndexe*)?\n\nFor the local segments, I see what you mean - it is possible that several threads will ask a PP for the same Dir+Term. PPP implementations can still work well in such scenario (if they wish to process payloads of local Dir as well) by holding a ThreadLocal PP for Dir+Term combination? I think proper documentation should be enough in this case. The whole point of this issue is to allow better control when addIndexes* are used. Affecting local payloads is a nice bonus, and I think we should wait for a real scenario which takes advantage of that.

But I'm not sure I want to reuse the same classes for that purpose, for several reasons:\n* The classes have the word Payload all over the place - javadocs, names etc. And for a good reason IMO - that's what they do.\n* One is expected to include different PP for different Directory and Term, but to convert the NumericField terms, I don't think one will use different PPs at all? I.e. a single TermsConverter / NumericFieldsTermConverter will be good for whatever Directory + Term?\n* The sort of operation you suggest (converting terms) seems to be a one time op -- when I migrate my indexes? PPP on the other hand (at least in my case) will be used whenever I call addIndexes* so that I can process and rewrite the payloads of the incoming indexes.\n\nSo while both will do byte[] conversion, I think those are two separate tools. Your should probably exist in a o.a.l.migration package or something, because it will be relevant to index migration only? Or did I misunderstood you?",

    "description": "Lucene handles backwards-compatibility of its data structures by\nconverting them from the old into the new formats during segment\nmerging. \n\nPayloads are simply byte arrays in which users can store arbitrary\ndata. Applications that use payloads might want to convert the format\nof their payloads in a similar fashion. Otherwise it's not easily\npossible to ever change the encoding of a payload without reindexing.\n\nSo I propose to introduce a PayloadMerger class that the SegmentMerger\ninvokes to merge the payloads from multiple segments. Users can then\nimplement their own PayloadMerger to convert payloads from an old into\na new format.\n\nIn the future we need this kind of flexibility also for column-stride\nfields (LUCENE-1231) and flexible indexing codecs.\n\nIn addition to that it would be nice if users could store version\ninformation in the segments file. E.g. they could store \"in segment _2\nthe term a:b uses payloads of format x.y\".\n",
