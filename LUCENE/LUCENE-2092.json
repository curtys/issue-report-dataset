So I don't think it's worth the work unless we have to spin another 3.0 for additional reasons.\n\n+1\n\nBut you can commit to *3.0* branch and also *2.9* branch. I did'nt want to have commits in 3.0, because if I respin a release, I would not be able to only take *some* of the fixes into 3.0.0. That was the reason.\n\nFor now i marked this issue as fix for 3.1, 3.0.1, 2.9.2",
