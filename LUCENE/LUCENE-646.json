    "description": "\nThis patch contains numerous small fixes for the \"getting started\"\npages on the Lucene Java web site.  Here are the rough fixes:\n\n  * To results.jsp:\n\n    - changed StopAnalyzer -> StandardAnalyzer\n\n    - changed references of \"url\" to \"path\" (field \"url\" is never set\n      and was therefore always null)\n\n    - remove prefix of \"../webapps\" from path so clicking through works\n\n  * Fixed typos, grammar and other cosmetic things.\n\n  * Modernized some things that have changed with time (names of JAR\n    files, which languages have analyzers, etc.)\n\n  * Added outbound links to Javadocs, Wiki, Lucene static web site,\n    external sites, when appropriate.\n\n  * Removed exact version of Tomcat for the demo web app (I think all\n    recent versions of Tomcat will work as described)\n\n  * Other small changes...\n\nNet/net I think this is an improved version of what's available on the\nsite today.",
