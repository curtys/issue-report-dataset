            "body": "A small fix named KeepDocCount0Segment.Sept15.patch is attached to LUCENE-565 (can't attach here).\n\nIn mergeSegments(...), if the doc count of a merged segment is 0, it is not added to the index (it should be properly cleaned up). Before LUCENE-672, a merged segment was always added to the index. The use of mergeSegments(...) in, e.g. addIndexes(Directory[]), assumed that behaviour. For code simplicity, this fix restores the old behaviour that a merged segment is always added to the index. This does NOT break any of the good properties of the new merge policy.\n\nTestIndexWriterMergePolicy is slightly modified to fix a bug and to check that segments are probably cleaned up. The patch passes all the tests.",
