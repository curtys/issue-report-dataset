The test shows, how simple now usage of addAttribute() and so on is (no casts needed anymore).\n\nThe code compiles without any unchecked warnings. To test this, I enabled the warnings about unchecked operations globally (emitting about 350 warnings on whole lucene). Two places inside private code needs to add @SuppressWarnings, because the compiler does not know if one AttributeImpl really implements the questioned interface.",

            "body": "As I already started to move Lucene to Java 1.5, here an idea, how to get the generics in:\n\nI would propose to switch on all \"unchecked\" warnings (as in the supplied patch) by the <compilerarg/> in ant. The problem is then, that there are hundreds of warnings printed out. I would like to then add a @SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\") to all classes, that are not yet rewritten to generics for collections and other generified java things (like Class<?> in AttributeSource). The warnings should then disappear. We could then start to search for SuppressWarnings annotations in the source and start the classes one-by-one and add generics. By this it is simplier, because you only get warnings for the class you are working on.\n\nWhat do you think?",

            "body": "About the backwards compatibility: After adding generics, the backwards test should run all tests from 2.9 (compiled with 1.4) against the generified trunk jar. After branching I would start to manage this.\n\nNormally generics do not bring backwards incompatibility, because they are simple removed. You only have probloems at places, where the the erased generics should not be replaced by java.lang.Object. Eg in the AttributeSource.addAttribute() call, it should return a Attribute (subclass) as in 2.9 and not Object (because of this you need to generify the whole method by the generics prefix, defining \"A\" as subclass of \"Attribute\"). If you use an naive approach to add generics, it could lead to addAttribute returns Object (and so a link error would occur). To prevent this, the backwards tests against 2.9 are a good solution.\n\nBy the way, the generics for AttributeSource were copied from j.l.Class and its methods to get annotations :)",

The problem is now, that all non-generics classes in Lucene generate tons of warnings. I would like to proceed like the following:\n- Open a new issue that adds this compilerarg.\n- Add a @SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\") in front of each class, that (currently) produces warnings (should not be so many, hopefully).\n\nAfter that the compilation should run without warnings about unchecked casts and so on. When starting to add generics to some of the classes, the developer would remove the SuppressWarnings for the class he works on and start fixing the warnngs and adding generics.\n\nWhat do you think? Without that, it is hard to add the generics 100% safe and consistent without be lost in tons of warnings and so on.\n\nI will also update this patch to also remove the now unneeded casts in all addAttribute calls in Lucene (low priority).",
