It concerns the positions and offsets of term\nvectors. It seems that documentation (website) is not up to date. According\nto the file format page, offsets and positions are not stored! Is that\ncorrect?\n\nMany thanks,\n\nSamir\n-----\nIndeed, in the file formats term vectors section it doesn't talk about the storing of position and offset info.\n",
