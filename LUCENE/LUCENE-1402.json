I plan to commit later today.\n\nI renamed the new methods to checkIndex, deprecated the old ones, and fix their javadocs.\n\nI also added javadocs for CheckIndexStatus, plus a warning that this API is new & experimental and subject to change.\n\nI also changed thew CheckIndexStatus.newSegments to be package protected, since its type is SegmentInfos which is not public.",

            "body": "I did not realize about LUCENE-1354, so I am a little bit late with my concerns. In my opinion, the way how CheckIndex is implemented, is not the cleanest obect-oriented way. It looks like a standard console program, what it was at the beginning, but not like a tool for use in other tools (like startup or maintenance tasks of Solr or my project panFMP). There is one problem:\n\nWe have a *static* variable pointing to the output Stream. As this variable is static, it is everywhere the same. If I want to create a web application that checks two indexes and this maybe in parallel (because two users started the check index task), I cannot redirect the output stream to an individual \"console\" (e.g. the servlet output stream).\n\nIn my opinion, to be a handy tool, there should be some minor changes:\n - the class should have an public constructor getting the Directory\n - a public method to set the output stream for the instance (like IndexWriter does with setInfoStream())\n - the check/fix methods as instance methods\n\nThe main() method (which must stay static, which is clear) and the two static and deprecated methods, should instantiate an CheckIndex instance and call the methods using System.err",

For more detailed status info, look into instance variables.",

I created one, that contains all the comments and fixes also some bugs:\n- the parameter fix in static method remove\n- if infoStream/out==null NPE's at different positions\n- main() does not set output stream, so main() does not show any messages\n\nIt is not completely tested, but it compiles correct and works for me (using the API, not main()). \nSo it needs intensive testing, but should be OK.\n\nMaybe rename method fix() to fixIndex() in comparison to checkIndex().",

I'd like to keep CheckIndex itself stateless (except for its infoStream).\n\nOtherwise I think everything is merged!",

And JavaDocs notes the boolean return value.\n\nI am not sure if it works, but it would be good to have the check method that returns boolean available @Deprecated, i.e.\n@Deprecated public static CheckIndexStatus check(Directory dir, boolean doFix) throws IOException {\n final CheckIndexStatus stat=this.check(dir,doFix);\n return stat.clean;\n}\n\nI am not sure, if it can be done with the same method name, but it prevents drop-in-replacements of Lucene to work.",
