This appears to work well, the only thing I would ask for is a simple test for the task (maybe especially testing the option that changes the wrapped analyzer's classname from the default std. analyzer)\n\nDone in attached patch - thanks for catching this oversight.\n\nIn constructing the test, I noticed that I had not brought over the analyzer package abbreviation logic from NewAnalyzerTask; this is now present in NewShingleAnalyzerTask, so that \"analyzer:WhitespaceAnalyzer\" is functional as a param.\n\n*Edit*: Also removed some debug printing I'd forgotten to remove from NewShingleAnalyzerTask.",

    "description": "Spawned from LUCENE-2218: a benchmark for ShingleFilter, along with a new task to instantiate (non-default-constructor) ShingleAnalyzerWrapper: NewShingleAnalyzerTask.\n\nThe included shingle.alg runs ShingleAnalyzerWrapper, wrapping the default StandardAnalyzer, with 4 different configurations over 10,000 Reuters documents each.  To allow ShingleFilter timings to be isolated from the rest of the pipeline, StandardAnalyzer is also run over the same set of Reuters documents.  This set of 5 runs is then run 5 times.\n\nThe patch includes two perl scripts, the first to output JIRA table formatted timing information, with the minimum elapsed time for each of the 4 ShingleAnalyzerWrapper runs and the StandardAnalyzer run, and the second to compare two runs' JIRA output, producing another JIRA table showing % improvement.",
