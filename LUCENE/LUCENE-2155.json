But the actual end date would sometimes be 3/2/2545, depending upon when and where you ran the tests.\n",

    "description": "Some tests fail randomly (hard to reproduce). It appears to me that this is caused by uninitialized date fields. For example Uwe reported a failure today in this test of TestQueryParser:\n\n{code}\n /** for testing legacy DateField support */\n  public void testLegacyDateRange() throws Exception {\n    String startDate = getLocalizedDate(2002, 1, 1, false);\n    String endDate = getLocalizedDate(2002, 1, 4, false);\n{code}\n\nif you look at the helper getLocalizedDate, you can see if the 4th argument is false, it does not initialize all date field functions.\n{code}\n  private String getLocalizedDate(int year, int month, int day, boolean extendLastDate) {\n Calendar calendar = new GregorianCalendar();\n calendar.set(year, month, day);\n if (extendLastDate) {\n      calendar.set(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, 23);\n      calendar.set(Calendar.MINUTE, 59);\n      calendar.set(Calendar.SECOND, 59);\n ...\n}\n{code}\n\nI think the solution to this is that in all tests, whereever we create new GregorianCalendar(), it should be followed by a call to Calendar.clear().\nThis will ensure that we always initialize unused calendar fields to zero, rather than being dependent on the local time.",
