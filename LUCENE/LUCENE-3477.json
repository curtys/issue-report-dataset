Looks fine to me.\n\nRight, I too checked all of the locations, and as you say, all fall-throughs were to cases that were break-only.  This was likely intentionally generated code, rather than spookiness, and given that it's not intended to be user modifiable, probably not a problem or source of potential future problems.  That said, JFlex code generation should add breaks for emtpy/comment-only user-supplied action code, or at least turn off fallthrough warnings with a compiler directive.\n\nThe real problem here is the warnings, which Mike's patch fixes.  (Having to add \"naked\" breaks does seem weird, but it's functional.)\n\nI successfully regenerated from the .jflex sources ({{ant jflex}} under {{modules/analysis/common/}}, and all tests pass.\n\n+1",
