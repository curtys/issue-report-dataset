Ie it doesn't handle the first payload properly -- first payload should set the value for min/max.  So you won't hit this if your min is < 0.\n\nMaxPayloadFunction has the bug as well, but you won't hit it if your max is > 0.",

I'm probably not going to have time (off on \"vacation\" (scare quotes for Marvin) soon).\n",

Also I open a new issue requesting tests at all :-)",
