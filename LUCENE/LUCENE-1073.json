    "description": "The question of how to backup an index comes up every so often on the\nlists.  Backing up and index is also clearly an important fundamental\nadmin task that many applications need to do for fault tolerance.\n\nIn the past you were forced to stop & block all changes to your index,\nperform the backup, and then resume changes.  But many applications\ncannot afford a potentially long pause in their indexing.\n\nWith the addition of DeletionPolicy (LUCENE-710), it's now possible to\ndo a \"live backup\", which means backup your index in the background\nwithout pausing ongoing changes to the index.  This\nSnapshotDeletionPolicy just has to mark the chosen commit point as not\ndeletable, until the backup finishes.\n",
