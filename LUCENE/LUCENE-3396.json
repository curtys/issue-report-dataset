But if not on class level I would even remove the T parameter from ther getter method, because it does not really fit, it is only used there, not even on the setter.

So either make all T or use Object everywhere.",

At this stage, RAB is now the only extension of Analyzer.\n\nPatch includes a few unique changes:\n\n- Adds AnalyzerWrapper which is used by Analyzers which wrap other Analyzers.  This is necessary to allow access the TokenStreamComponents of the wrapped Analyzers, without making TSC public.\n\n- IndexSchemaRuntimeFieldTest is made out of IndexSchemaTest due to testRuntimeFieldCreation doing some thread-unsafe changes to the Analyzers stored in  IndexSchema.  When run in IndexSchemaTest, depending on the execution order, the test fails.  When run by itself, there is no problems.  I think this is okay because the actual code being tested is documented as being thread-unsafe and the test also notes it does some tacky things.\n\nI'm not going to look to commit this just yet, as I want to collapse Analyzer and RAB into a single class.",

This is a big chunk of work, but its time to bite the bullet.\n\nI plan to attack this in the following way:\n\n- Collapse the logic of ReusableAnalyzerBase into Analyzer\n- Add a ReuseStrategy abstraction to Analyzer which controls whether the TokenStreamComponents are reused globally (as they are today) or per-field.\n- Convert all Analyzers over to using TokenStreamComponents.  I've already seen that some of the TokenStreams created in tests need some work to be reusable (even if they aren't reused).\n- Remove Analyzer.reusableTokenStream and convert everything over to using .tokenStream (which will now be returning reusable TokenStreams).",
