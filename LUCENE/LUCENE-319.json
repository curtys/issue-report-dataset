It does not affect the current release. I tried to fix the\nbug. Seems to work. But I am not 100% sure. Another way to fix the bug would be\nto switch off the optimization by simply deleting score(HitCollector hc) and\nscore(HitCollector hc, int max) implementation from BooleanScorer. I tried\nthis and it works too.\n\nChristoph",
