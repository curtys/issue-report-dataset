I think the better way might be to have the FieldSortedHitQueue#comparatorAuto method use the ExtendedFieldCache, instead of creating the dependency in FieldCacheImpl on ExtendedFieldCache to have long support.  \n\nThen, you could just override getAuto in ExtendedFieldCache.   \n\nThis way, those who have longs and want them treated as such get them from the ExtendedFC, otherwise, those just using FieldCacheImpl, get the behavior they are used to, namely no long support.",
