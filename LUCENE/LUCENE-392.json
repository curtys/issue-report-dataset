You're test case uses Field.Index.NO for the\nnon-stringreader case.  This ends up bypassing the bit of code I mentioned in\nDocumentWriter (see the if() block on line 140 of DocumentWriter, for our test\nthe Field has to be an Indexed, tokenized field) .\n\nTry these lines instead:\n\n    doc.add(new Field(\"body\", \"laber\", Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.TOKENIZED));\n    doc.add(new Field(\"body2\", \"blubb\", Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.TOKENIZED));\n    doc.add(new Field(\"body3\", \"bla\", Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.TOKENIZED));\n\nI got about 10-30% slower results with class cast because using this example of\nTokenised text, the class cast does actually get thrown and caught.  Yes,\nresults are quite broad, but the instanceof test slowest result was always\nbetter than the faster classcast results.\n\nModern VM's exception creation is miles better than it used to be, but older\nVM's were pretty awful.  I wonder what the difference is with, say, JDK 1.3.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is only a minor performance improvement, but it can\nadd up when doing a LOT of documents with a lot of fields, hence I thought this\nwould be a worth while improvement.\n\n\n",
