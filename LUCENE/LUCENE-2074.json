I actually think we don't yet use it\nenough...\n\nEG, LUCENE-1255 was one nasty bug, that we at first fixed, but then\nrolled back, because of the back-compat break.  Then it was\nrediscovered and opened again, as LUCENE-1542, when we decided it was\nnasty enough to just fix it and put an entry in CHANGES that you\nhopefully will read.\n\nBut it really is a back-compat break, in that apps could quite easily\nbe relying on the buggy behavior.  I think that bug would have been a\ngood reason to add Version to IW.\n\nFixing invalid acronyms in StandardAnalyzer, but then leaving it\nbroken by default, was the original \"inspiration\" for Version.  We\nshouldn't every fix a bug, but then be forced to leave the bug in\nplace due to back compat.\n\nVersion lets us fix bugs, change defaults for the better, etc., w/o\ncompromising on our back compat policy.  It's an impoprtant\ntool...\n\nbq. The problem is, these are the hard backwards compat situations that it was created for - the whole analyzer package was/is bound to have lots of Version stuff.\n\nRight, I think Version will especially find its way into changes that\nalter what's indexed (analyzers, bugs like LUCENE-1255, etc.).",

After that apply the patch. The patch clearly shows, that even after regeneration with Java 1.5, the original version using Java 1.4 (Unicode 3) is equal to before (esp. the DFA matrix). The 31-version is different (other matrix).\n\nIf we later create new versions, we can call them 32 etc.\n\nThis patch solves the JFlex 1.4 problem with needing the explicit java version. It currently requires the trunk version of JFlex, which would be no problem for this parsers (as verified, that they produce the same DFA & code for 1.4). So other speak up, Steven Rowe? What do you think. Only developers need the trunk version at the moment as the generated files are in the checkout.\n\nHopefully JFlex 1.5 comes out until we release 3.1, I would be happy. In later issues we can optimize the newly added 31 version with more unicode features, the Orig version stays as it is. We could also remove the special cases in the latest version like replaceInvlaidAcronym and so on, as this only applies for Version.LUCENE_2x.",

It would hep us to not require a Java 1.4 JRE just to convert the jflex files.\n\nThe new parsers (see patch) are pre-generated in SVN, so somebody compiling lucene from source does need to use jflex. And the parsers for StandardTokenizer are verified to work correct and are even identical (DFA wise) for the old Java 1.4 / Unicode 3.0 case.",

And the parsers for StandardTokenizer are verified to work correct and are even identical (DFA wise) for the old Java 1.4 / Unicode 3.0 case.\n\nMost of the StandardTokenizerImpl.jflex grammar is expressed in absolute terms - the only JVM-/Unicode-version-sensistive usages are [:letter:] and [:digit:], which under JFlex <1.5 were expanded using the scanner-generation-time JVM's Character.isLetter() and .isDigit() definitions, but under JFlex 1.5-SNAPSHOT depend on the declared Unicode version definitions (i.e., [:letter:] = \\p{Letter}).\n\nI'm actually surprised that the DFAs are identical, since I'm almost certain that the set of characters matching [:letter:] changed between Unicode 3.0 and Unicode 4.0 (maybe [:digit:] too).  I'll take a look this weekend.\n",

I'll take a look this weekend.\n\nBecause of that we have the patch: We now have two flex files, one with %unicode 3.0, which produces the same DFA as the old flex file when processed with Java 1.4 (as it was in Lucene 2.x). This is used for backwards compatibiulity (using the matchVersion parameter of ctor).\n\nFor later Lucene versions we will have a new jflex file (currently unicode 4.0) and that produces the same matrix as java 1.5 in jflex 1.4 (at the moment).\n\nBy that we simply made the parser regeneration invariant to the developer's JVM. About nothing more is this issue at the moment.",
