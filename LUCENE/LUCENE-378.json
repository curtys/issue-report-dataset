    "description": "src/gcj/Makefile hardcodes the command names for gcj, gcjh, and g++. This makes it difficult to \ncompile with a particular version of GCJ if multiple are installed with suffixes (eg, gcj-4.0)\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Configure, compile, and install GCC/GCJ with something like --program-suffix=-4.0\n2. cd ~/src/lucene && ant gcj\n\nExpected results:\nSomehow be able to specify my compiler.\n\nActual results:\nCan't find 'gcj' executable, or worse runs wrong version. :)\n\nSuggested fix: as is common with variable names like CC to force a C compiler, allow the builder to \noverride the compiler commands used by setting optional environment variables GCJ etc.\nPatch to be attached.\n\nAdditional info:\nBuilding Lucene from SVN 2005-04-19.",
