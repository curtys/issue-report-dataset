This is rather simple (only again, that Arrays.hashCode() appears only first in Java 1.5 :-(, see LUCENE-1415).\n\nAnd juhee, this is now my fifth or sixth patch for a Lucene project (TIKA and LUCENE together), I think I am ready to apply for Apache Contributor status :-), currently I am only contributor and maintainer of a module in PHP core (which is a Apache related project, but a little bit special).\n\nAs a side-note to the discussion about the serialization issues and the contributer status discussion on java-dev...",

    "description": "During developing for my project panFMP I had the following issue:\nI have a cache for queries (like Solr has, too)  for query results. This cache also uses the Sort/SortField as key into the cache. The problem is, because Sort/SortField does not implement equals() and hashCode(), you cannot store them as cache keys. To workaround, currently I use Sort.toString() as cache key, but this is not so nice.\n\nIn corelation with issue LUCENE-1478, I could fix this there in one patch together with the other improvements.",
