I \nhave not tested the changes (I don't use those analyzers) but the changes \nshould be trivial enough so they don't break anything. \n \nCould someone apply the patch and also fix FrenchAnalyzer? It's the same \nchange as for the other files, but I didn't manage to make a clean diff \nbecause of encoding problems.",
