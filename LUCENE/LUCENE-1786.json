    "description": "contrib/analyzers/compound has some tests that use a hyphenation grammar file.\n\nThe tests are currently for german, and they actually are nice, they show how the combination of the hyphenation rules and dictionary work in tandem.\nThe issue is that the german grammar file is not apache licensed: http://offo.sourceforge.net/hyphenation/licenses.html\nSo the test must download the entire offo zip file from sourceforge to execute.\n\nI happen to think the test is a great example of how this thing works (with a language where it matters), but we could consider using a different grammar file, for a language that is apache licensed.\nThis way it could be included in the source with the test and would be more practical.\n",
