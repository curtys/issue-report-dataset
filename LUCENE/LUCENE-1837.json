It didn't work as you can see by: LUCENE-1087\n\nThe issue got worse when we went to per segment. We attempted to fix in LUCENE-1771, but we just made the old faulty behavior doable again, and added cruft to the API that will encourage further abuse.",

Weight still an abstract class, the sub reader with the doc still the reader passed rather than top level reader.\n\nThe only revert:\n\nBecause TermWeight tried to take index level stats from the reader, we passed that searcher (to make the TermWeight explain behavior like it was when we passed top level reader) - its the only place its used currently. But thats illegal now and it was illegal before.\n\nYou cannot count on having access to the entire index through a Searcher - else we break MultiSearcher and remote use.\n\nSo passing that Searcher is a recipe for illegal abuse. Same with the other issue Tim brought up - though if we end up passing an IndexSearcher there with all kinds of warnings to abuse at your own peril - I guess we could here.\n\nI'm not sure I like it because we encourage code that doesn't work correctly with MultiSearcher. I think if we wan't to go down that road, we should probably try to move away from support remote and multisearcher.",

Because TermWeight tried to take index level stats from the reader, we passed that searcher (to make the TermWeight explain behavior like it was when we passed top level reader) - its the only place its used currently.\n\nPhraseQuery also prints the [top-level] docFreq for each term in the phrase.\n\nbq. You cannot count on having access to the entire index through a Searcher - else we break MultiSearcher and remote use.\n\nI agree, so our fix in LUCENE-1771 doesn't work w/ MultiSearcher.  So we definitely need to do something here...\n\nThe thing is, it's useful for TermQuery's explain to print out the docFreq/maxDoc, right?  (This was the original motivation of LUCENE-1066).  But, it has to be the top-level numbers, not the single-segment numbers.\n\nReally the Weight should gather & hold all top-level stats it needs on construction?

I've said it before myself - index level stats should be taken from the createWeightSearcher - I just don't integrate thoughts well :)\n\nSo that seems like the right thing to do - only thing I don't like is that this info has to be calculated by calling each Searchable in the MultiSearcher, and then\nyou likely won't ever use it - explain is generally debug stuff. I don't like that.\n\nBut I guess, if you want the info, you gotto do what you gotto do ...",
