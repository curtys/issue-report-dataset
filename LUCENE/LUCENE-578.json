Not that adding this before will cause any harm, but it may cause some confusion.  Also, we should modify the top-level build.xml to include javadoc from gdata-server into Lucene's javadoc.\n\nPlease feel free to update this patch if you make progress in the next day or so before I manage to commit it.\n\nThanks!",

The diff file contains all the changes again.\nI did modify the toplevel build.xml to generate java-doc for the gdata project.\nI also added a war task to the gdata build.xml to create a war file. This might be moved somewhere else and also the target dir might be changed during later developement.",

This should not happen if you simply generate a patch with something like 'svn diff > gdata-server.txt' from the top-level of the Lucene trunk.  Can you please re-generate this patch?  Thanks.",

The windows tortoise svn did add the file twice, that caused the double added files in the diff. Now I created one on the linux platform and everything is alright. I did applied the patch to a second local working copy.\nI did install the tortoise svn again and now thisone is working as well. Sorry about that.\n\nThe diff file diff_06_06_06.diff contains all the sources!!\nthe libs are already added as tar files.\n\nsimon",
