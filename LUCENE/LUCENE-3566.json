Perhaps it was a mistake; however, according to my colleague, who had experimented with the IB method in our own engine and proposed to add the parameter to Lucene, a well chosen {{c}} can improve the results. Well, duh really; nevertheless, as long as we have defaults, shouldn't be a problem. :)",
