The only things left are:\n\n* IndexReader#getFieldCacheKey() - what do we do with that one?\n* calls to IndexInput#readChars() and #skipChars() - I think we have to keep those until 4.0?\n\nAll core & contrib tests pass. It'd be good if someone could review this patch though.",

The method snapshot() of SnapshotDeletionPolicy was changed to return IndexCommit instead of IndexCommitPoint.

In this case it is also valid to change the bw branch code and not only tests.\n\n(I only looked over the patch, but didn't test it, to find the same things like yesterday.
