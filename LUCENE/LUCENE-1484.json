Jason can you review\nit?\n\nDetails:\n\n  * Fixed the bug causing test failures (we were not in fact cloning\n    the FieldsReader in reopenSegment(), causing NPEs)\n\n  * Put back the call to isDeleted() in SegmentReader.document -- we\n    lost the synchronization by inlining it.\n\n  * Move fieldStreamTL.close() back out of the \"if (isOriginal)\" block\n    in FieldsReader.close.\n\n  * Put lost \"private\" back in front of a couple methods/members\n\n  * Added javadocs\n\n  * Removed dead code\n\n  * Added CHANGES entry\n\n  * Other small fixes...\n",

We normally only backport bug fixes.\n\nAlso, 2.4.0 has proven quite stable and I don't think at this point we're planning on a 2.4.1 release (at least it hasn't been discussed yet).\n\nI'm hoping, instead, that we can release 2.9 in not too much time.\n\n",
