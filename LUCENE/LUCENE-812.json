These APIs were never released (ie only available in the\ntrunk builds).\n\nSince there is no longer a notion of the \"global default lock\ndirectory\", I'm not really sure how to (or whether to) fix this: these\nlock factories really need to know the directory to store their lock\nfiles in.\n\nThe fallback is to instantiate the LockFactory ahead of time and pass\nit into FSDirectory.getDirectory().  Is that fallback workable here?\n\nI'd lean towards \"won't fix\" on this unless someone can suggest a good\nsolution.  That property can still be used for other lock factory\ninstances that require no arguments on construction.\n",

Currently there is not a single LockFactory that will NOT cause an InstantiationException.\n- if the code is a leftover from some intermediate nightly snapshot, remove it and remove any reference to the system property too.\n\nI can live with both scenarios. I just entered this issue as I thought that the behaviour of the code ... is a bit unexpected.

            "body": "One of the original motivations of this property was the ability to\nalso choose LockFactory implementations external to Lucene (the\noriginal issue had a lock factory that used MySQL for locking).  So\nthe property is still useful for that use-case.\n\nUnfortunately we can't deprecate this (there is no compiler/runtime\nsupport for deprecating a random property?).  I guess we could remove\nsupport for it (in 2.2 or 2.1.1?) and throw an exception if we see\nthat the property is set (to catch users who had started using it) but\nthat seems rather harsh.\n\nSo ... I think we should in fact support it (but in the future we\nshould not add any more new System properties to Lucene, I think).\n\nI plan to modify Simple/NativeFSLockFactory to have no arg constructor\nthat sets their lockDir to null, and then add logic to\nFSDirectory.getDirectory to set its own dir as the lockDirName if it\nsees that the incoming LockFactory is one of these two instances with\na null lockDir.\n\nThe other 2 builtin LockFactory implementations already have no-arg\nconstructors so they work fine through this property.\n",

    "description": "While trying to move from Lucene 2.0 to Lucene 2.1 I noticed a problem with the LockFactory instantiation code.\nDuring previous tests we successfully specified the LockFactory implementation by setting the property\n${org.apache.lucene.store.FSDirectoryLockFactoryClass} to \"org.apache.lucene.store.NativeFSLockFactory\".\nThis does no longer work due to a bug in the FSDirectory class. The problem is caused from the fact that this\nclass tries to invoke the default constructor of the specified LockFactory class. However neither NativeFSLockFactory\nnor SimpleFSLockFactory do have a default constructor.\n\nFSDirectory, Line 285:\n          try {\n            lockFactory = (LockFactory) c.newInstance();          \n          } catch (IllegalAccessException e) {\n            throw new IOException(\"IllegalAccessException when instantiating LockClass \" + lockClassName);\n          } catch (InstantiationException e) {\n            throw new IOException(\"InstantiationException when instantiating LockClass \" + lockClassName);\n          } catch (ClassCastException e) {\n            throw new IOException(\"unable to cast LockClass \" + lockClassName + \" instance to a LockFactory\");\n          }\n\nA possible workaround is to not set the property at all and call FSDirectory.setLockFactory(...) instead.
