Specifically with this commit:\n\n{code}\ncommit 5d371928263d8d78d0e52781340ae95506bd9bf6\nAuthor: Robert Muir <rmuir@apache.org>\nDate:   Mon Feb 6 12:48:01 2012 +0000\n\n    LUCENE-3749: replace SimilarityProvider with PerFieldSimilarityWrapper\n    \n    git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/dev/trunk@1241001 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68\n{code}\n\nI have the following configuration in my schema.xml:\n\n{code}\n<fieldtype name=\"payloads\" stored=\"false\" indexed=\"true\" class=\"solr.TextField\" >\n  <analyzer>\n    <tokenizer class=\"com.foo.lucene.analysis.core.PayloadTermTokenizerFactory\"/>\n    <filter class=\"solr.DelimitedPayloadTokenFilterFactory\" encoder=\"float\"/>\n  </analyzer>\n  <analyzer type=\"query\">\n    <tokenizer class=\"solr.WhitespaceTokenizerFactory\"/>\n    <filter class=\"solr.LowerCaseFilterFactory\"/>\n  </analyzer>\n  <similarity class=\"com.foo.lucene.search.PayloadSimilarity\" />\n</fieldtype>\n{code}\n\nBut when I build against and use a version of a Solr with the commit mentioned above, my similarity class is no longer executed. I've confirmed this by putting prints in the scorePayload(), tf() and idf() functions and noticing they print before and don't print after including that commit.\n\nIt seems this is intentional, based on Robert Muir's comments, but how can you get per-field similarity to work in Solr with this new code?",
