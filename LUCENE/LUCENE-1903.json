In my opinion, the code works now identical to the 2.4.1 one (without the output buffer). Unigrams are simply detected by shingleBufferPosition==0. The position increments are also tested by your code and the implementation also looks right. In principle, there was only missing the increment of the shingleBufferPosition if no unigrams are provided.\n\nMark: If you want to build RC3 soon, just assign yourself and commit this fix. I will go to bed now. I will commit this tomorrow, if you hadn't. A CHANGES.txt entry is not needed in my opinion, as this is not a new feature or a bug from 2.4.1.",

A CHANGES.txt entry is not needed in my opinion, as this is not a new feature or a bug from 2.4.1.\n\nThis could prob be debated from a lot of angles - in the end, it appears pretty much up to each committer what they do -\n\nMy rule of thumb has been - when it comes to me, be modest, skip where it makes sense. But when it comes to someone else having reported\nthe issue - I always add a credit somehow. Outside contributions (in whatever form) deserves credit for reporting things and suppling things (especially tests), and I think it encourages that behavior to a small\ndegree. Proper credit to outside contributers is very important I think - thats why we put someones name right next to ours, even when the user\nmay have just reported the issue and we did all the work - or even if two people did 98% of the work and some guy drops a patch that changes\n2%. Just my two cents on the subject though - take it for what its worth.",

Chris: Could you test this patch\n\nLooks ok so far, but unfortunately I doubt I'll be able to test it in a real-world setting before you guys want to freeze the code and/or release. (I usually use not just ShingleFilter but ShingleFilter combined with the LUCENE-1370 patch. It was in looking into to upgrading LUCENE-1370 to work with the trunk that I discovered this bug.)\n",
