            "body": "I have also seen this bug come up.  It seems that there are only 15 possible tiers, as if the best fit tier is greater than 15, then it is scaled back to 15.  So one plausible solution that doesn't require any changes to the API, is to simply require all documents have all 15 levels indexed.  The other solution is to take into account the range of indexed levels when calculating the the best fit tier, but this would require an API change, although it could be made backwards compatible quite easily.\n\nAny thoughts on the preferred approach?",

    "description": "In the CartesianShapeFilterBuilder, there is logic that determines the \"best fit\" tier to create the Filter against.  However, it does not account for which fields actually exist in the index when doing so.  For instance, if you index tiers 1 through 10, but then choose a very small radius to restrict the space to, it will likely choose a tier like 15 or 16, which of course does not exist.",
