I assume it has only \nbeen public for technical reasons, not because we expect this to be used \nfrom outside of Lucene? Should we deprecate this method? Its \nimplementation e.g. in FSDirectory looks a bit scary anyway (the comment \ncorrectly says \"This is not atomic\" while the abstract class says \"This \nreplacement should be atomic\").\n",
