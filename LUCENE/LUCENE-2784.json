We should really remove usage of MultiFields here, all Filters and Queries now work directly on segment readers.\n\nI agree, we don't need multifields in these queries.

Mike and you decided that. MTQ's internal handling can also live with null enum. I will look further into it and post modified patch!",

In my opinion this is also not the right thing (I don't know for what reason this was added). Maybe we should simply also change MTQ.getTermsEnum() to simply take a enum to wrap?",

As some MTQs may quicker return EMPTY for some reasons, like for a range when upper<lower. So you don't even need to look into the IR's fields/terms. So I would lie to remove the checks in MTQ and simply call always MTQ.getTermsEnum and then exit if empty. Thats much more clean. I was just wondering why these checks were added by Mike? For TermRange and Numeric its too much work.",

If we would change this and place it on the first term of the underlying enum we would break everything: TermsEnum must be unpositioned initially before next() [this was the broken thing before 4.0] and we would have an unneeded seek on a never needed term.\n\nSo you can remove that comment from patch!",
