And if thats a filter, it should be a standard way, \nonly inherited from existing offsets and not 'offset mathematics' and not A, AB, B in some places and A, B, AB in others.\n\nReally i think we need to step it up if we want highlighting to be first-class citizen in lucene, nothing checks the offsets anyhwere at all,\neven to check/assert if they are negative, and there are little tests... all we have is some newish stuff in basetokenstreamtestcase and\na few trivial test cases.\n\nOn the other hand, for example, position increment's impl actually throws exception if you give it something like a negative number...\n",

If you go and edit your index with a hex editor... there are no guarantees on what may ensue!\n\nDisk IO can produce wrong data. We must check this if we can and it costs nothing, which is the case here (see above).\n\nI was already talking with Robert, there are other asserts in the index readiung code at places completely outside any loops, executed only once when index is opened. Its first priority to do consistency checks of the read bytes. Otherwise you can even produce endless loops at some places. - Of course not when you have tight loops, but things like checking that the document count is in line with e.g. some other value from liveDocs is essential. I will open an issue for that, the older Lucene formats are much besster secured, but trunk is horrible, just because some people here seem to want to prevent any check, which is also a security issue when you e.g. download indexes through network connections and a man in the middle modifies the stream.

I see Mike's point though: readVLong() is very general, so someone could be using it where performance is important.\n\nThe check is only ommitted in the unrolled loop, the for-loop still contains the check. In that case it also handles maybe too-long vints correctly, which the unrolled code will never do. The unrolled code also has a bug, that it handles negative longs wrong, but that should be prevented (in my opinion also for ints).\n\nThe current assert for both long and int is completely harmless, as it will only be executed, if the vInt/vLong has the maximum number of bytes, which is very unlikely. And as said before the check is done in the loop-based code, too. And comparison in perf showed that the speed of the unrolled loop and the standard loop are identical, so about what are you talking?\n\nThe good thing here is that we can (in the unrolled loops) harden the check for negative vInts, as because of the unrolled loop we have a separate cocde branch already, so we can modify the check (which was always done before my unrolling) to do the better check.\n\nI had the idea at that times to unroll that loop because of Java bugs, so the bug is caused by me and I want to fix it the correct way, definitely without loosing anything.

The original while loop then simply proceeds with reading bytes util the highest bit is null. The unrolled loop behaves different (and thats a real bug), because it will silently not read those remaining bytes, so the file pointer is on a different byte after the call. This also affects readVInt!!!\n\nIn my opinion, we should unroll *all* readVInt/readVLong loops so all behave 100% identical! And in the case of the last byte read (where the current assert is), throw exception. If we don't unroll all readVInts we have to somehow also make the loop exit after too many bytes are read, which would be an costly extra check in the loop - thats the reason why I want to unroll all loops to fail after 5 or 9 bytes.",

But, unfortunately, we sometimes rely on this... had we had this assert in 'since the beginning' we could have avoided that.\n\nSo, if we can't add that assert in today, I think we should at least fix readVLong to handle negative longs... but then you quietly spend 9 bytes (even more trappy!).",
