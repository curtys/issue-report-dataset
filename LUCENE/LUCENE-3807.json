Its implemented by two classes: SortedTermFreqIteratorWrapper,\nwhich sorts in UTF-16 order, and HighFrequencyDictionary, which returns terms from the index (so UTF-8 order). The problem is that classes\nthat rely upon sorted order like JaSpell/TST are likely broken already. Fortunately FST/WFST always do their own sort.\n* Buffering in RAM is not ideal. Instead I think all of these classes should be using our Sort anyway which can spill to disk.\n\nFor now could we put the BytesRefList in the suggest package since its only used there? we might not need it after we clean up\nthis sorting stuff in some future issue.\n\nAlso I don't think we should factor out the BytesRefIterator. I seriously think its a bad idea to tie our core index Terms enumeration API\nwith the spellcheck API at this time, it would make it hard to change in the future if we need, especially with spellcheck being... needing work :)\n",

TST and Jaspell still support add and get is still implemented on all others but its not part of the interface. The main thing that buggs me with add is that its inconsistent with build since it allows arbitrary output while build uses a Number. \nOnce we need this we can add it back to the interface. \n\nTST and Jaspell are now optimized to not necessarily create new Float objects all the time but share instances if the incoming weight allows it. I also create Number instances based on the range which might safe some more memory while minor IMO.\n\nLookupResult now also returns a long instead of a float to be consistent with the TermFreqIterator.\n\nSortedTermFreqIteratorWrapper is now based on the On-Disk sort. I extended the sorter impl a little to work with Comparator<BytesRef> and fixed the TODO by using BytesRefList with ByteBlockPool internally.
