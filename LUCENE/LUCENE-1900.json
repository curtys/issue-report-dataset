And I guess we should just remove the part that mentions its involved in the weight? Or re word.\n\n\"This is used as an approximation of the number of documents in the index for scoring calculations.\"\n\nOr something to that effect (namely, better). Perhaps approximation isnt even needed - \n\n\"Because un-merged deleted docs still contribute to index statistics, this is used as the number of documents in the index for scoring calculations.\"\n\nor ...",
