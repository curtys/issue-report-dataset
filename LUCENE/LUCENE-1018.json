    "description": "\nThe TestConcurrentMergeScheduler throws intermittant exceptions that\ndo not result in a test failure.\n\nThe exception happens in the \"testNoWaitClose()\" test, which repeated\ntests closing an IndexWriter with \"false\", meaning abort any\nstill-running merges.  When a merge is aborted it can hit various\nexceptions because the files it is reading and/or writing have been\ndeleted, so we ignore these exceptions.\n\nThe bug was just that we were failing to properly check whether the\nrunning merge was actually aborted because of a scoping issue of the\n\"merge\" variable in ConcurrentMergeScheduler.  So the exceptions are\nactually \"harmless\".  Thanks to Ning for spotting it!\n\n",
