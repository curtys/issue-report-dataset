    "description": "I'd like to remove SortField.AUTO... it's dangerous for Lucene to\nguess the type of your field, based on the first term it encounters.\nIt can easily be wrong, and, whether it's wrong or right could\nsuddenly change as you index different documents.\n\nIt unexepctedly binds SortField to needing an IndexReader to do the\nguessing.\n\nIt's caused various problems in the past (most recently, for me on\nLUCENE-1656) as we fix other issues/make improvements.\n\nI'd prefer that users of Lucene's field sort be explicit about the\ntype that Lucene should cast the field to.  Someday, if we have\noptional strong[er] typing of Lucene's fields, such type information\nwould already be known.  But in the meantime, I think users should be\nexplicit.\n",
