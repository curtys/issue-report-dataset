In return, those expert users shouldn't complain if the internals change ;-)",

Is that really necessary, to change them after construction?\n\nI have a tendency to prefer protected setters over protected fields, but there is precedence for this, e.g, BooleanQuery.minNrShouldMatch, so I don't think that part is exceptional.",

(I am indexing stem forms and original forms, but I only want to match original forms with a fuzzy term, otherwise I get to much noise). However, FuzzyQuery is a final class and I cannot extend it.  \n\nAs discussed in the mailing list (http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/38756), we want to make the private variables and inner classes protected.\n\nI am attaching a patch for FuzzyQuery.java that implements this. I ran all unit tests and they passed without errors.\n\nAndreas.",
