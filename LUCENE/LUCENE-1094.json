I plan to commit in a day or two.\n\nI added a test case showing the issue & confirming the fix.\n\nI also made a small improvement to the bulk-copy stored fields during\nmerge optimization: the segment to be merged does not have to have\nidentical fieldName -> number mappings as the merged segment.\nInstead, it just has to be a subset, ie, the fieldName -> number\nmapping for all fieldNames in the segment to be merged must match.\nIt's OK when the merged segments has additional fields beyond this.\n",

    "description": "DocumentsWriter writes the number of stored fields, up front, into the\nfdtLocal buffer.  Then, as each field is processed, it writes each\nstored field into this buffer.  When the document is done, in a\nfinally clause, it flushes the buffer to the real fdt file in the\nDirectory.\n\nThe problem is, if an exception is hit, that number of stored fields\ncan be too high, which corrupts the fdt file.\n\nThe solution is to not write it up front, and instead write only the\nnumber of fields we actually saw.",
