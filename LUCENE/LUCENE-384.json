    "description": "I am performing a range query that returns results if the terms are lower \ncase, but does not return result when the terms are mixed case.\n\nIn my collection, I have terms alpha, beta, delta, gamma.  I am using the \nStandardAnalyzer for both indexing and searching.\n\nThe query [alpha TO gamma] returns all four terms.  When I perform the query \n[Alpha TO Gamma], no results are returned.\n\nIt appears the lowerCaseFilter(), which is a part of the StandardAnalyzer, \ndoes not work properly on the search terms.  I've used Luke to peek at my \ncollection, and the terms are all lower case in the collection.\n\nI'm fairly new to Lucene, so I hope I'm not making a \"common mistake\".",
