IndexSearcher is the right class to be passed to Query#weight / Query#createWeight and Weight ctors should take it too.

This is absolutely the recommended way but I see a little risk for people calling ExecutorService#shutdownNow()  which interrupts the executing threads and can cause a AlreadyClosedException down in one of our NIO Directories if there are still searches going on etc. I don't think this is super important but I would point it out in the JDoc to give folks a heads-up.

I'm not asking for a backport but i think we should do some targeted javadoc+deprecations:\n* I think we should deprecate Searcher, suggesting to use IndexSearcher instead. Searcher->IndexSearcher is probably the only way \nthis change will affect 99% of users and so this fixes that case, as most users make a simple change to their code.\n* We could add some wordage to MultiSearcher, such as 'if you are making a MS of IS you might want to consider MR instead'. This would\nbe nice since we are still going to have the lurking combine() bug, at least people then know that MR is recommended.\n* i think it would be nice to add something to contrib/remote so users expect to change their code? Personally I think we should deprecate.\nDeprecate doesn't mean there has to be a 1-1 replacement... sometimes we re-think and it wasnt the best idea all along. But deprecation\nhelps alert anyone using it so they wont be surprised with 4.0",
