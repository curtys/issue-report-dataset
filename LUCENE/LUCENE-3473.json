            "body": "Patch adding the checks to checkindex.\n\nthere were some problems:\n* IndexReader.getUniqueTermCount doesn't work in trunk, but works fine in 3.x. This is because it sums per-field across the Terms api, but PreFlex codec doesn't know this information per-field\n* If a field has no postings (but exists in fieldinfos), then IR.getUniqueTermCount hits an NPE (ant test-core -Dtestcase=TestNorms -Dtestmethod=testCustomEncoder -Dtests.seed=-6a2248fc7313e45:c41a685f840f6ed:-5a3fd5b8ec315508)\n* MemoryCodec didn't implement Fields.getUniqueTermCount, probably just forgotten because its not abstract (instead throwing UOE by default).\n\nSo, i fixed MemoryCodec to impl Terms.getUniqueTermCount, changed Terms.getUniqueTermCount to be abstract (throw -1 if you cannot implement it), and added Fields.getUniqueTermCount, called by IR.getUniqueTermCount: default implementation sums across fields, but PreFlex overrides so that its IR.getUniqueTermCount works again.\n\nwe might want to deprecate the latter method when 3.x indexes no longer need to be supported, or maybe its just fine as-is (you have to do the summing somewhere).",

            "body": "More fixes:\n* catch(UOE)'s are removed in checkindex because now this stat just returns -1 like other stats when it isnt available.\n* DR.getUniqueTermCount returns -1 like MR now, and I adjusted the test to expect this rather than the exception.\n* Preflex is disabled in the test: only because we currently 'write' preflex indexes actually as PerFieldCodecWrapper... which is bogus but a larger issue. Still, the preflex method is being tested for the older indexes when checkIndex runs. once we fix PreFlexRW to be a \"real codec\" that writes actual valid 3.x indexes we can remove the assume()\n",

            "body": "Hmm, I noticed i left a s.o.p in the previous patch for preflex, but it wasn't being called from CheckIndex.\n\nThis is because we always wrap PreFlex inside PerFieldCodecWrapper... even if its a 3.x index! This is a problem as it still perpetuates the loss of IR.numUniqueTerms.\n\nSo in this patch we no longer do this, which means I'm able to remove the assume as well.\n\nBut, now that preflex is being tested I think I've found an off-by-one with this statistic when the field name is the empty string. \n\nI'm gonna see if i can make a testcase/issue against 3.x separately for this... because this patch is already too big. \n\nNOTE: reproduce with: ant test -Dtestcase=TestIndexWriter -Dtestmethod=testEmptyFieldName -Dtests.seed=57fd2807ecfb5a2b:5556d32d3a1f68b7:469f7ed779c63825 -Dtests.codec=PreFlex",
