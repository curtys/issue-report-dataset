The thing was broken in 3.x and 3.0, too as it was not threadsafe, if the same capabilities object was used in multiple threads.\n\nTrue, I think we have the opportunity to fix it in 4.x since we have to break the interface anyway.\n\nShould we do anything about 3.x? It seems good to fix bugs, but it would be frustrating (if someone has a custom RegexCapabilities) to break the API in 3.x, then in 4.x again!\n",
