    "description": "The similarity method in FuzzyTermEnum is synchronized which is stupid because of:\n- TermEnums are the iterator pattern and so are single-thread per definition\n- The method is private, so nobody could ever create a fake FuzzyTermEnum just to have this method and use it multithreaded.\n- The method is not static and has no static fields - so instances do not affect each other\n\nThe root of this comes from LUCENE-296, but was never reviewd and simply committed. The argument for making it synchronized is wrong.",
