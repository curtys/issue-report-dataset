Solr has switched from using the boolean rewriting WildcardQuery,PrefixQuery to ConstantScore queries. We already put in the ConstantScoreRange query for just these reasons, so I think it makes since to add the rest of the family. An upside will be that I can add support for these queries to the Span highlighter. That will put our Highlighter in a position of being able to highlight pretty much every major query type, which I think is an important goal.\n\n- Mark",

There would still be the issue of IDF potentially skewing results but the coordination factor is potentially useful here. \n\nI think in general IDF tends to be useless for \"auto-expanded\" terms e.g. Wildcard, fuzzy etc. Incidentally, we still see that IDF issue in fuzzy queries ranking rare mis-spellings higher but that's another issue (one I resolved in contrib's FuzzyLikeThisQuery).\n\nI suppose one other consideration is for people who have created any doc boosts e.g. trying to use this to boost by date.\n\nI don't think any of these cases necessarily outweigh the benefit to be obtained from switching \"wildcard/prefix to constant score queries\"\n\n\nCheers,\nMark\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Is there any reason to keep the rewrite-to-BooleanQuery\n\nIn addition to the coord example Mark mentioned, there are also cases where the tf and idf values for terms matching a wildcard/prefix are meaningful ... but the other advantage to keeping the existing implementations is use cases where the number of unique terms a query expands to is  is very small, but the number of documents matched is very large ... in theory (but i haven't tested this) the expanding queries should be more efficient in space and equally efficient in time as the ConstantScore equivalents.\n\nbq. It would then be possible to just switch the QueryParser or other code by e.g. setting a global (static) flag.\n\nI'm loath to see more static \"setter\" methods added to query clauses, but there's no reason this couldn't be a member property on instances of the classes with corresponding properties on QueryParser.\n\nIn theory it could even be a tertiary state property: REWRITE_TO_BOOLEAN, REWRITE_TO_CONSTANT_SCORE. REWRITE_GUESS ... where the third option caused the REWRITE method to make it's best guess using a first pass at the TermEnum iteration and aborting if the number of terms get's above some threshold.\n\n(but that kind of \"optimization\" would be premature without testing .. the point is it would be possible)",

Thanks Mark.\n\nI think we should indeed \"factor up\" into MultiTermQuery the ability to create a ConstantScoreQuery out of the filter generated by enumerating the terms and walking the docs for those terms?  Then we don't need to special case in each of the subclasses.\n\nMaybe we can then fix Wildcard/Prefix/RangeFilter to create the corresponding query and then ask it for its filter (assuming we make a method eg \"getDocIdSet\" in MultiTermQuery)?  Or I guess we could just make a QueryWrapperFilter around the corresponding query, though that seems rather roundabout.  I don't think we need to have duplicated code in PrefixFilter, RangeFilter, WildcardFilter.\n\n{quote}\nWhen I was talking about deprecating constantscorequery being awkward, its wasnt really in the implementation sense (i think we can leave it as is), but more the deprecating one of the newest queries already  Still don't consider that a huge deal though.\n{quote}\n\nWell ... this is just how software evolves :)  You can't control which code will be the \"victim\" of a nice refactoring.

Instead, even in tests that didn't involve any skip-to (not sure what/if any of these cases actually do, still wrapping my head around that), the non generate the bitset first approach was a tad slower rather than faster. Don't know exactly why I the moment, but thought I'd chronicle the attempt for future optimizers. Probably all the stuff that happens between next calls slows down the enumeration quite a bit, so that doing it all at once saves enough time to make up for the OpenBitSet stuff.",
