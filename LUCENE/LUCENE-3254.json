    "description": "In working on LUCENE-3246, I found a few problems with\nBitVector.isSparse:\n\n  * Its math can overflow int, such that if there are enough deleted\n    docs and maxDoc() is largish, isSparse may incorrectly return true\n\n  * It over-estimates the size of the sparse file, since when\n    estimating number of bytes for the vInt dgaps it uses bits.length\n    instead of bits.length divided by number of set bits (ie, the\n    \"average\" gap between set bits)\n\nThis is relatively harmless (just affects performance / size of .del\nfile on disk, not correctness).\n",
