Before there was also support for java.io.File instead of o.a.l.store.Directory in this class for which this null-check was.\nI removed the initial null check in the ctor, as it is not necessary (this class is internal only and never called with NULL directory).",

The null check is unnecessary as if directory is null line 579 would throw a NPE.\nI removed the null check and made the member \"directory\" final. In addition I added a null check in the constructor as If the value is null we should catch it asap. \n\n",
