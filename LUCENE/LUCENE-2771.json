But for this reader we should support reopen and implement it in the FilterIndexReader with optimized norms recreation (copy over in the map only reopened segments?).\n\nAnother thing about MultiNorms: We are inconsistent now: We are using MultiFields everywhere in core queries but not MultiNorms. E.g. for a TermQuery you can currently get a Scorer, but as soon as this scorer requests norms, it will throw UOE. We should be consistent. As we have now the SlowMultiReaderWrapper, we should remove MultiFields support from everywhere else in core (Filters and Queries, but also FieldCache?). *+1 for that from my side!*\n\n*EDIT* We use MultiFields nor everywhere anymore, eg no longer in TermQuery/Scorer. But still in filters and other parts. So we should open issue to remove all usage!",
