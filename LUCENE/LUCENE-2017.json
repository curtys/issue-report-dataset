The\nclose method works around this.\n",

The lifecyle is different, as close()'ing 1 instance of ClosableThreadLocal will take care of all threads that have accessed it (vs only the caller thread for ThreadLocal).\nThis is a very subtle difference, and should be documented as such in ClosableThreadLocal IMHO:\n\nYou only need to close() a ClosableThreadLocal instance once, whereas you need to remove() a ThreadLocal instance from every thread that accessed that ThreadLocal instance.\n\nThat said, wouldn't we risk that one thread close() the ClosableThreadLocal when other threads are still using it? That would invalidate currently used values!\n\nGiven that all threads supposedly follow the same code path, wouldn't a remove() be called by each thread?",

            "body": "If we would do it that way, we wouldn't need the CloseableThreadLocal at all. Because even with 1.4 you can do a remove() by simply setting the value to null (internally remove() does exactly that, see src.java in yor jdk). So CloseableThreadLocal is needed.\n\nAbout the multiple-Threads closing problem: This does not affect Lucene, as it keeps track, when it can be closed. If you close it to early it is the same as closing an IndexInput at the wrong time. So do not worry!",
