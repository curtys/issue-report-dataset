Since it  also extends Field which has its own TokenStream field, NumericField now uses the field from TokenStream rather than its own.\n\nThe more and more this is discussed the clearer it is that Field should be the base class of the Field hierarchy, and not AbstractField or Fieldable.  The issue of having all the setters and configurations will be addressed in LUENE-2308 when we move them all to FieldType.  Field will become a simple tuple consisting of at least a value and type, and possibly a TokenStream.\n\nNumericField and LazyField are customisations of Field controlling certain aspects of the tuple.  For NumericField that is the TokenStream and setting the value.  For LazyField that is the value.",

Because it is modifiable, consumers can add to it directly rather than through Document.\n\nIf it were unmodifiable, then it would be possible to control adding Fieldables in Document, which would then allow us to wrap Fieldable instances in a Field subclass, meaning Document would only have a List<Field>.\n\nGiven this limitation, I'm currently thinking about not trying to deprecate Fieldable in 3.x, but instead adding the unmodifiable list method and deprecating #getFields().  I would also add some functionality for removing Fieldables, which seems to be all thats lack in Document.  Then in 4.x I would deprecate Fieldable.\n\nSlow process, but I think by deprecating AbstractField now we have already made a step forward to improving this hierarchy in preparation for the FieldType classes.\n\nRemaining in this work is a code cleanup of all 3 classes, so that code is understandable when we add in FieldType.",

A Document is a point in time object - you parse a document, extract metadata, converts the entire flow to a Lucene object (in this case Document) and passes it along to IW.

Will you still have getFields(), only now it will return an unmodifiable collection?\n\nI guess the unmod collection can be returned even today, right?\n\nBTW, what happens if getFields() return an unmod collection, but someone calls doc.add(Field)? I think the unmod collection prevents you from adding to that collection wrapper, but not for that collection to be changed from under the hood? If that's true, then that could cause some trouble ... so getFields() will really return a snapshot of Document, which means we need to clone Fields ...\n\nGets too complicated no? Maybe just do: (1) Doc implements Iterable and (2) Doc exposes numFIelds(), add(Field)?\n\nAbout remove(field), I thought of a possible scenario though I still don't think it's interesting enough - suppose that you pass your Document through a processing pipeline/chain, each handler adds fields as metadata to the Document. For example, annotators. It might be that a field A exists, only for a handler down the chain to understand A's meaning and then replace it w/ A1 and A2.

I am trying to foresee what people might be doing via getFields() and thus are not going to be able to do when its gone.  We will have the ability to add and iterate, so having the functionality to remove seems to complete it.  I completely agree that if something happens and a CME is thrown, then that problem should be left to the user.\n\nI think this clarifies this direction.  Document will be changed as follows:\n- Document will become Iterable<Fieldable>\n- getFields() will be deprecated in favour of the Iterable\n- numFields() will be added returning the number of fields\n- remove(String) will be added allowing someone to remove Fields with the given name.  If a CME occurs, thats up to the user to handle.\n\nCheers Shai!\n\n",

Therefore the IndexableDocument, rather than returning Fields, could return instances of a new Tuple class, which would be immutable.  Field would then implement Tuple.\n\nDocument and Field would then be exactly as suggested, 'user space' app friendly mutable classes.  \n\nOn the search side, the 'core space' wouldn't know of the idea of a Document, but rather a set of tuples.  We would then allow different consumers of those tuples to be provided.  One such consumer would use the tuples to build Documents and Fields again. ",

API like getIndexedFields(docId) and getStorefFields(docId), both optionally take a FieldSelector, should allow the application to re-construct its Indexable however it wants. And IR/IS don't need to know anything about that.\nTo complete the picture for current users, we can have a static reconstruct() on Document which takes IR, docId and FieldSelector ...\n\nBTW, I'm not even sure getIndedxedFields can be efficiently supported today.

However Document will be a user space construct that spans both indexing and searching since its API is designed to be flexible and easy to use and manipulate.\n\nWriting implements of Indexable will be an expert thing I imagine, so if you index bytes taken from a socket, then I imagine you'll choose an implementation on the search side that can handle it.  If your stream from a socket has some custom stuff, then you could write a custom consumer on the search side that builds whatever search construct you want.",

But that is away from that issue: Indexable provides an iterator of fields that consist of name and TokenStream and some options (possibly like omitNorms). If you just dont want to have close() in TokenStream, let's remove it. end() is needed for offsets, the indexer need to take care. incrementToken() is the iterator approach. What else is there? Reset may be invisible to indexer (I would refactor that and would make a subclass of TokenStream that supports reset, ResetableTokenStream - like Tokenizer supports reset(Reader), which is also a subclass). The abstract TokenStream then is only consisting of incrementToken() and end() + the AttributeSource access methods. Attributes needed by indexer are only TermToBytesRefAttribute, PositionIncrementAtt, OffsetAttribute and PayloadAttribute.",

With a cleanup and eventually FieldType this would be way less painless I guess. I have a couple of questions and comments to the current patch. \nBtw. I like the fact that the previous patch was uploaded March 21 2010 and the latest took 1 year to come up on march 23 2011 :)\n\n* Why do you reformat all the stuff in Field, is that necessary here at all? I mean its needed eventually but for the deprecation of things it only bloats the patch really doesn't it?\n\n* When you deprecate AbstractField and Fieldable, Field should ideally be a standalone class. So I see that this still needs to subclass Fieldable / AbstractField but could it stand alone now so that we can simply remove the extends / implements on Field once we drop things in 4.0? I think it looks good from looking at the patch though\n\n* I don't like the name getAllFields on Document since it implies that we have a getPartialFields or something. I see that you can not use getFields since it only differs in return type which doesn't belong to the signature though. Maybe we should implement Iterable<Field> here and offer an additional method getFieldsAsList or maybe getFields(List<Field> fields)\n\n* once we have this in what are the next steps towards FieldType? Will we have only one class Field that is backed by a FieldType but still offers the methods it has now? Or doe we have two totally new classes FieldTyps and FieldValue, something like this:\n{code} \nclass FieldValue {\n  FieldType type;\n  float boost;\n  String name;\n  Object value;\n}\n{code}\n\n* I wonder if this patch raises tons of deprecation warnings all over lucene where Fieldable was used? In IW we use it all over the place though. We must fix that in this issue too otherwise uwe will go mad I guess :)\n\nthanks for bringing this up again!",

I mean its needed eventually but for the deprecation of things it only bloats the patch really doesn't it?\n\nBecause for me this issue is about reducing the complexity of these classes and Field is a mess.  Making it more readable reduces the complexity.  If needs be I will do this in two patches, but I don't feel this issue is resolved till the code in Field is readable.\n\nbq. When you deprecate AbstractField and Fieldable, Field should ideally be a standalone class. So I see that this still needs to subclass Fieldable / AbstractField but could it stand alone now so that we can simply remove the extends / implements on Field once we drop things in 4.0? I think it looks good from looking at the patch though\n\nI don't really understand what you're suggesting here.  In 3x where the deprecations will be occurring Field has to continue to extend AbstractField.  Yes in 4.0 we can drop that extension but addressing the deprecations is not in the scope of 3x.\n\nbq. I don't like the name getAllFields on Document since it implies that we have a getPartialFields or something. I see that you can not use getFields since it only differs in return type which doesn't belong to the signature though. Maybe we should implement Iterable<Field> here and offer an additional method getFieldsAsList or maybe getFields(List<Field> fields)\n\nYeah good call.  I think implementing Iterable<Field> is best, but it will also require adding a count() method to Document since often people retrieve the List to get the number of fields.\n\nbq. once we have this in what are the next steps towards FieldType? Will we have only one class Field that is backed by a FieldType but still offers the methods it has now? Or doe we have two totally new classes FieldTyps and FieldValue\n\nOnce FieldType is in, all the various metadata properties (isIndexed, isStored etc) will be moved to FieldType, leaving Field as what you suggest as FieldValue.  Field will contain its type, boost, name, value.  If we have Analyzers on FieldTypes, then we will be able to remove the TokenStream from Field.\n\nbq. I wonder if this patch raises tons of deprecation warnings all over lucene where Fieldable was used? In IW we use it all over the place though. We must fix that in this issue too otherwise uwe will go mad I guess\n\nYeah but not in 3x unfortunately.  As it stands people can retrieve the List of Fieldables via getFields() and add whatever implementation of Fieldable they like.  Consequently we need to continue to support Fieldable in IW for example.  Once this code has been committed I will create a new patch for trunk which moves all of Solr and Lucene over to the Field.  I could do this in many places already of course, but that core classes like IW would have to remain as they are.\n\nI will wait for your thoughts on the reformating and then make a new patch.\n\n",
