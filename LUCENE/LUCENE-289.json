            "body": "Do you think this is a bug in the OS X linker?  Can other linkers handle symbols\nnamed delete$?  If it's not a linker bug, then it's a GCJ bug, no?  Java and C++\nhave different reserved words, and GCJ needs a mechanism to escape these when\nthey conflict.  If adding dollar sign breaks the linker then perhaps GCJ should\ndo this some other way.\n\nI'm not saying that we should or shouldn't integrate this patch, rather that we\nshould consider the patch a workaround for a bug with GCJ and/or the OS-X\nlinker.  Since it's an API change it's a workaround that we may never undo. \nStill we should use it as an opportunity to improve GCJ (or OS X) so that the\nnext time someone reasonably names a method 'delete' in Java they don't prohibit\nthemselves from using GCJ (or GCJ on OS X).\n",

That is a reserved\nkeyword in C++ and these methods cause trouble for gcj which implements a clever\nworkaround in renaming them delete$ but the OS X dynamic linker doesn't pick-up\non it.\nThe attached patch renames delete(int) to deleteDocument(int) and delete(Term)\nto deleteDocuments(Term) and deprecates the delete methods (as requested by Doug\nCutting).",
