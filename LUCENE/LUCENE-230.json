If any document in the results set (Hits) has a missing value \nin the sort field, the entire call throws an [uncaught] exception during the \nsorting process with no results returned. \n\nThis is an undesireable result, and the prospects for patching this problem \noutside the search classes are ugly, e.g. trying to patch the index itself.\n\nThis is actually a critical function in my application. Thank you for \naddressing it.\n\n-Dan",
