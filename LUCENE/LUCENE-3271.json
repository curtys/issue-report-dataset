I guess if we had a query-expansion module, I would think it belonged there.\n\n{quote}\nFieldCacheRewriteMethod -> This doesn't belong in this contrib or the queries module. I think we should push it to contrib/misc for the time being. It seems to have quite a few constraints on when its useful. If indeed CONSTANT_SCORE_AUTO rewrite is better, then I dont see a purpose for it.\n{quote}\n\nMy vote would actually be to move this to src/test! :) Yeah there are some scenarios where this thing could be faster, but really I thought it was just a good way to add seek to the doctermsindex termsenum. I do think it and its test would be a nice addition to src/test, if someone wants to use it the can always snag it from there... its that expert.\n\n{quote}\nFuzzyLikeThisQuery -> suggest module. This class seems a mess with its Similarity hardcoded. With all that said, it does seem to do what it claims and with some cleanup, it could be good.\n{quote}\n\nI actually made some comments about this query in the flexscoring branch: http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/dev/branches/flexscoring/lucene/contrib/queries/src/java/org/apache/lucene/search/FuzzyLikeThisQuery.java\n\nIn my opinion, as a rewrite method (i think it would require 2, one for the variant that ignores TF), we could get better performance out of this with cleaner code... in other words you would just use ordinary FuzzyQuery and set this rewrite method for its scoring heuristic, or a BQ of FuzzyQueries if you are doing the expansion thing\n\n{quote}\nSlowCollated* -> They can stay in the module till we have a better place to nuke them.\n{quote}\n\nThis is all totally deprecated code that seems nice in contrib to reflect the fact that its not scalable...  I don't think its a huge issue where it goes due to the fact its deprecate and the name :)\n\nFinally, I wanted to say that its my opinion that we shouldn't put garbage in modules. Modules should be treated like core I think.... yet at the same time I totally support efforts to cleanup contrib, either removing sandy stuff or refactoring it where it belongs in a module.\n\nOne option could to create a sandbox directory either under lucene (it contains src/java and src/test but is totally an unorganized sandbox), or itself as a contrib temporarily (contrib/sandbox) and take a look at contrib and move stuff thats good into modules, but toss all the 'odd things' into this sandbox. \n",

Do you have other thoughts for what could go into a query-expansion module?  If so, then I'll go with it.  I just know that MLT doesn't belong with the queries anymore.\n\n{quote}\nbq.

I'm going to do a code cleanup on each of the classes to goes into the module. Test coverage will be looked into as well. At this stage I don't think any of the classes I've suggested moving to would be deemed garbage.\n\n{quote}\nOne option could to create a sandbox directory either under lucene (it contains src/java and src/test but is totally an unorganized sandbox), or itself as a contrib temporarily (contrib/sandbox) and take a look at contrib and move stuff thats good into modules, but toss all the 'odd things' into this sandbox.\n{quote}\n\nI actually really like the idea of a sandbox.  I think for simplicity, its best to make it a contrib.  That way we can easily get it up and running.  It also won't 'stain' anything that isn't already stained.\n\nAs part of this work, I'll push the SlowCollated* stuff to the sandbox, along with FuzzyLikeThis.",
