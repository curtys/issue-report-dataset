In that case, would it be safer if just NIOFSDir used NIO?\n# Can copyTo(Directory, Collection<String>) be changed to copyTo(Directory, Iterable<String>)? Unless we think that someone would want to use size() or something.\n# I know it's a matter of style, but you \"import static Arrays.asList\", and then use asList directly in copyTo(Dir). It confuses me because I expect asList to be a method declared on Dir, and so I prefer to see Arrays.asList. But it's just style, don't know how others feel about that.\n# On copyTo(Dir), perhaps instead of converting the listAll() to List and then remove elements from it, you can just iterate on whatever listAll() returns and add the files that pass the filter to a list? You can even optimize and if all the files Dir returned pass the filter, you can just pass the array to copyTo(Dir, Iterable), assuming we change the method to accept Iterable. But that's a minor optimization.\n# copy(src, dest, boolean) - can you add a message to @deprecated so users will know what to replace it with more easily?\n# I see that copy(src, dest) also accepts a boolean of whether to close the src directory. But copyTo(dIr) doesn't. I personally think it's ok, as someone can call close on src himself, but am wondering if it wouldn't be more convenient. I.e. instead of change calls from Directory.copy(src, dest, true), I now need to do src.copyTo(dest) followed by a src.close().\n# closeSafely - perhaps print the stacktrace, even if you don't throw it?",

I think your proposal makes sense - let's start w/ NIO bulk-copy and then we can disable if people complain or report errors.\n\nConsistency is important, I agree. So let's keep Collection there. I just wanted to avoid converting arrays to a Collection, just so that they can be iterated on. Seems a waste to me, but not so much to argue about :).\n\nRe (7), I hate such libraries too. But I hate more the ones that just hide problems away from me :). The ideal thing was if Lucene would use a logging mechanism (I once started it on LUCENE-1482) so that you could include the stacktrace print if logging is enabled. But currently the code just hides the problem away ... and I'd hate to debug such thing, not realizing an IO exception is thrown from close().\n\nSo unless LUCENE-1482 springs back to life again, what do you suggest we do?

From my knowledge and a quick check with Java 5, it does not. Passing an array to a method taking Iterable does not work. Arrays only work in extended for statement, but not because they are Itearble. The generated code by javac is also totally different (and more effective than creating an iterator, it just uses the conventional for(i=0; i<length; i++) approach - try it out with javac and decompiling with jad or whatever)! Also arrays of native types can hardly implement Iterable without autoboxing.\n\nSee:\n- [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1160081/why-is-an-array-not-assignable-to-iterable]\n- [http://72.5.124.102/thread.jspa?threadID=558036&tstart=607]\n\nAnd where is the waste of calling Arrays.asList()? This is exactly the same overhead like creating an iterator() if arrays were Iterable, both are just \"views\" on the array, so no copy involved.",

I think that closeSafely (or as I prefer it - closeNoException) should be closed only when you know you've hit an exception and you want to close the stream suppressing any exceptions. Otherwise call close().\n\nbq. can we add a boolean arg (suppressExceptions) to control that?\n\nThat would beat the purpose of the method no? I mean, currently it does not throw any exception, not even declaring one, and if we add that boolean it will need to declare \"throws IOException\", which will force the caller to try-catch that exception and ... suppress it or document \"// cannot happen because I've passed false\"?\n\nSo how about we call it closeNoException, document that it does not throw any exception and intentionally suppresses them, and if you don't want them to be suppressed, you can call io.close() yourself?",
