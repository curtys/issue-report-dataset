After that I create a deprecated subclass of TermRange* with the old name and all ctors from the old class. The new class will only supply the new ctors (no deprecated ones using Term, mapping is done in the subclass).",

Please note, that it will not apply to your checkout, because it needs a SVN rename of RangeQuery, RangeFilter and RangeTermEnum to Term*.\n\nThis patch also converts all tests and contrib to use the new classes and non-deprecated ctors. In TermRange* all deprecated methods are removed and only stay alive in the old classes. The new TermRangeQuery use constant score mode per default (as planned for 3.0), but the old deprecated classes use boolean rewrite per default. I will edit the tests after this commit, to also test boolean rewrite (because of the new defaults, only constant score rewrite ist tested)\n\nI will commit this soon (approx 2 hours) in two steps (first the patch, then svn add of the new deprecated classes) to not prevent people from doing things.\n\nAll tests, especially bw-tests pass.",

As the new classes are separated (deprecated one and new one), I will change it to not have this strange getLowerTermText methods in the new class.\n\nSo I will prepare a new patch and do all tests again, no commits for now.
