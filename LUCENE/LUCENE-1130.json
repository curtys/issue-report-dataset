We have a disk full test scenario in our project and I'll test \nRC2 + your patch today!\n\nI think we should definitely push this into 2.3. I'll build RC3 after\nI finished the tests and you committed it.",

I'll wait another day before\ncommitting.\n",

Then, when we finish the next document, it will never\nactually write because missing finishDocument call never happens.\n",
