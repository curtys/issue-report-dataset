(why allowing to create \n  a multi-reader with no readers at all?)\n\n",

Maybe because they use such a small amount of documents that they never need a MultiReader? The NPE happens when one constructs the MultiReader with its only public constructor, MultiReader(IndexReader[] subReaders). This construtor is never used in Lucene, not even in the test cases.",

I think the MultiReader(IndexReader[]) constructor should allways call super(null) --  anyone currently relying on MultiReader.directory() it to return the directory of the \"first\" IndexReader should be able to easily change their code.  if we want to make it really easy we could provide a MultiReader.getSubReader(int n) method.",

If rrr.isCurrent() throws unsupported, the application needs to question recursively. \n\nI am not aware of such an application, so you could argue this is only theoretic, still it demonstrates a strength of Lucene.  Also, here too, as argued above, even if the answer is false (not current), the application would need to apply the same recursive logic to reopen the non-current reader and reconstruct the multi-reader. \n\nSo I agree it is valid to throw unsupported.\n\nJust that it feels a bit uncomfortable to throw unsupported for existing API of a method with well defined meaning that is quite easy to implement (relying on that anyhow it was never implemented correctly). \n",

I would object to a recursive isOptimized ... that one really doens't make sense at all for a multi-directory MultiReader ... in theory it should allways return false since by definition the index is not a single segment, but if you do that, so code could try to optimize it.\n\n",
