What's wrong with just subclassing QueryParser and overriding the desired methods?\n\nI think subclassing would work fine too, as long as we fix QueryParser so that instead of doing things like:\n{code}\n  TermQuery q = new TermQuery(...);\n{code}\n\nit would do:\n{code}\n  q = newTermQuery(...);\n{code}\n\nand then define a newTermQuery(...) method which a subclass could then override.  Is that what you have in mind Erik?  John does this sound OK?",

This usage of QueryParser is relatively arcane. Hiding all these methods away in a separate class means less clutter and less effort for most people scanning through the API docs of an important, commonly used class.",

            "body": "I think the idea of sub-classing makes more sense when you're talking about a QueryParser. The parser includes, mainly, two logics - parsing a query into query \"segments\" or \"nodes\" and then creating the appropriate Lucene Query instance for each sengment/node.\nBy modifying QueryParser so that it uses protected callback methods for creating the appropriate Query instance for different node types, you get a very clean and elegant query parsing solution.\nAll sub-classes can share the same parsing rules (which generally don't change), and just instantiating their own TermQuery or PrefixQuery instances.\n\nWouldn't you need to do that anyway with the Query factory? I mean, what if I want to create all the query types like the default implementation, but change the PrefixQuery instance to something I wrote? Wouldn't I need to extend the default query factory? Sounds exactly like extending QueryParser to me.\n\nI recently implemented a query parser for a different query syntax than Lucene's, but I still wanted to create Lucene Query objects. The parser includes different protected callback methods like getTermQuery, getPhraseQuery, getPrefixQuery etc, providing a default implementation to each of course. It parses the query into \"nodes\" and then invoke the appropriate callback method per node (i.e., for a phrase node, it invokes getPhraseQuery).\nWe have several sub-classes which extend this parser to provide their own implementation for various node types (for example, this approach allows you to remove any \"prefix\" or \"wildcard\" nodes from the query, without touching the parser).",

People are going to want more customizations than just changing the types of created subclauses, and will need to subclass for these other types of changes anyway.",

I'm not sure if that would work in all cases (surely not for BooleanQuery), but might for most of 'em.\n\nFor example, what if newTermQuery(Term term) returned a Query instead of a TermQuery?   That'd add a fair bit more flexibility, as long as none of the calling code needed a specific type of Query.\n\nThe hoops we jump through because we're in Java.... sheesh.  :)",
