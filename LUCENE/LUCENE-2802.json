This is also a thread safety issue since IR should not touch the writer's segmentInfos outside of sync(IW).\nit seem like there is more about all that in DR - we should really only use the uncloned SegmentInfos if we are not in NRT mode #getVersion uses it too which is wrong.\nI actually rely on the isOptimized in several tests and run into a NPE due to that though so we should really fix DR to use a private SegmentInfos or restrict the uncloned one for the isCurrent comparison\n\n",

            "body": "I changed DirectoryReader to use the cloned version of SegmentInfos instead of two of them inconsistently. The only failure I get is on TestIndexWriterReader line 105 \n{code}\n    r1.close();\n    writer.close();\n    assertTrue(r2.isCurrent());\n{code}\n\nwhere the writer is closed and afterwards it checks if the r2 reader still is the current one which failes since the writer.close() method changes the version of the SegmentInfos. In my opinion this is actually the semantics I would expect from #isCurrent(), the question is if we would want to change the semantics to return false from #isCurrent if the writer we used to obtain the reader from is closed.\n\nI think we should consider it for consistency and simplicity though.

The actual reason IMO why this has been introduced was that the RT reader returns true from #isCurrent() if the wirter was closed which is actually wrong since closing a writer changes the index and the reader should see that change.\n\nI also added a testcase for is current to check the semantics",
