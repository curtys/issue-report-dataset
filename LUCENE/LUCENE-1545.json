Ie, with matchVersion (LUCENE-1684) we could preserve back-compat on this issue, but I'm not sure how to cleanly push that matchVersion (provided @ runtime to StandardAnalyzer's ctor) \"down\" into the grammar so that eg we're not force to make a new full copy of the grammar for each fix.  (Though perhaps that's an OK solution since it'd make it easy to strongly guarantee back compat...).",
