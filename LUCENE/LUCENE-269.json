    "description": "We are using HTML parser for parsing English and other NL documents in \nEclipse.  Post Lucene 1.2 there has been a regression in the parser.  \nCharacters coming from Reader (obtained from getReader() ) are corrupted.  \nOnly the characters that can be encoded using the default machine encoding go \nthrough correctly.  For example, parsing Chinese document on an English \nmachine results with all characters, except the few English words, corrupted.",
