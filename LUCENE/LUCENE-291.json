    "description": "hi all,\n\nthe current implementation of FSDirectory.create(...) silently deletes all files\n(even empty directories) within the index directory when setting up a new index\nwith create option enabled. Lucene doesn't care when deleting files in the index\ndirectory if they  belong to lucene or not. I don't think that this is a real\nbug, but it can be a pain if somebody whants to store some private information\nin the lucene index directory, e.g some configuration files.\n\nTherefore i implemented a FileFilter which knows about the internal lucene file\nextensions, so that all other files would never get touched when creating a new\nindex. The current patch is an enhancement in FSDirectory only. I don't think\nthat there is a need to make it available in the Directory class and change all\nit's depending classes.\n\nregards\nBernhard",
