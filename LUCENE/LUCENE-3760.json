This makes incremental update process \"restart- and rollback- safe\" as it gets written on lucene commit and read on startup. I do not index this field (not to pollute term dictionary) and I need only to keep max value of it. \n\nI find it hugely useful, but if you have better ideas on how to safely persist max/min value of the field I am all ears. \n\nLast time I checked, solr DIH used its own file in cfg directory to persist max(timestamp), which is kind of risky as it is not in sync with lucene commit point under all scenarios. \n\nI think I even opened an isue on solr jira to expose \"user commit data\"  feature to solr, but I am missing good ideas on how to expose it to solr users (max/min/avg field tracking maybe)...\n\nCheers, eks",

We have a need to merge the input Directory's commit data with the target index's commit data. Since we use the optimized writer.addIndexes method, it is a waste to open an IndexReader to retrieve the commit data.\n\nAnother place is where we just need to read the commit data to extract information, without actually needing an IndexReader instance.\n\nIn short, this method is very useful to us, and I don't see the advantage of making it deprecated. I don't mind if we move it to a DirectoryUtil class if it bothers anyone that it's on IndexReader.\n\nWe don't use IndexReader.getVersion so I don't mind if it becomes deprecated, but I wonder, if there's no real advantage, what's the harm of keeping it?",

I don't remember on which issue, but I wanted to do that once, and discovered that it breaks either the backwards tests, or current running code (with the new .jar). That's why the method documents that in practice it returns a sorted List.",

I mean in the full picture of the application, is there another way?\n\nOne of my use cases is a distributed system which receives 'delta' indexes that need to be merged with a bigger one. There, I open FSDirectory and use IndexWriter.addIndexes(dir). I don't need to load the IndexReader. What I do need though is read some time stamps and other metadata that I put in the index's commit data and merge that with the target index's commit data.\n\nbq. Opening an indexreader doesnt load norms until you ask for them, for example\n\nThis is from SegmentReader's ctor. I followed IndexReader.open() and reached it, without any 'ifs' (unless I missed something):\n\n{code}\n      instance.core = new SegmentCoreReaders(instance, dir, si, readBufferSize, termInfosIndexDivisor);\n      if (doOpenStores) {\n        instance.core.openDocStores(si);\n      }\n      instance.loadDeletedDocs();\n      instance.openNorms(instance.core.cfsDir, readBufferSize);\n{code}\n\nIt does load the norms and deleted docs (and maybe even doc stores).\n\nbq. Well its still available in 3.x as deprecated methods... were you planning on making a patch against 3.x for LUCENE-3786 initially?\n\nThere are two questions here:\n\n(1) Was I planning to support SearcherTaxoManager in 3.x -- YES\n(2) Was I planning to start with a patch against 3.x -- Not Necessarily.\n\nbq. here's an idea: how about we defer this discussion until we see your patch? If it makes sense for LUCENE-3786, then we have a valid use case?\n\nWhy? Isn't the scenario that I described above enough?
