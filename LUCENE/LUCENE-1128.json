I have noticed w/ SVN that I was getting things like this from svn stat:\n{quote}\nA  +   src/java/org/apache/lucene/benchmark/byTask/tasks/SearchTravRetHighlightTask.java\n{quote}\n\nWhich means that SVN thinks there is a history for the file.  Turns out, it is from doing a copy of another file.  Thus, I had to remove the file and then readd it.\n\n",
