I was thinking initially that deprecated methods would be removed on version 4, I'm not sure anymore. Will it be removed on 4 or 3.1?\nyou should drop those methods from 4.0 code if you want to deprecate. Since this is a contrib you don't necessarily need to deprecate so you could alo drop them from 3.1 or even from 3.0.x",

Usually we put changes into trunk first and then move them to the branches though. Now this issues has been closed / resolved and it has not been committed to trunk and neither to 3.0.4 as stated in the FixVersion? Now I am confused...\n\nSo 4.0 changes go into trunk:\nhttp://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/dev/trunk/\n\nChanges for 3.x go here\nhttp://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/dev/branches/branch_3x/\n\nAnd eventually you deprecations can go here to be in 3.0.4 if that gets released at all...\nhttp://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/java/branches/lucene_3_0/\n\nand / or here:\n\nhttp://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/java/branches/lucene_2_9/\n\ndoes that make sense?",

Usually we put changes into trunk first and then move them to the branches though.\n\nThanks for letting me know about the correct procedure, I will follow it next time. I'm planning to open another JIRA to commit the changes agains the trunk soon.\n\nbq. Now this issues has been closed / resolved and it has not been committed to trunk and neither to 3.0.4 as stated in the FixVersion? Now I am confused...\n\nMy misunderstanding here, at first, I thought 3x_branch was the next release 3.0.4, I just realized that 3.0.4 is the 3.0 version with bug fixes and 3x_branch is the code for next 3 version (3.1?). So I still need to propagate the API changes to 3.0 branch and trunk (4.0).\n\nNow I'm confused about what is the main difference between 3.0.x and 3.x. Can any API changes go in 3.0.4 or just bug fixes?\n\nThanks,\nAdriano Crestani",
