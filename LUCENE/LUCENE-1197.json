    "description": "There is a silly bug in how DocumentsWriter tracks its RAM usage:\nwhenever term vectors are enabled, it incorrectly counts the space\nused by term vectors towards flushing, when in fact this space is\nrecycled per document.\n\nThis is not a functionality bug.  All it causes is flushes to happen\ntoo frequently, and, IndexWriter will use less RAM than you asked it\nto.  To work around it you can simply give it a bigger RAM buffer.\n\nI will commit a fix shortly.",
