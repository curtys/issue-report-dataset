One of the recent changes to Http11Protocol.java \nadded pause() and resume() methods which call log.info() to record the actions. \nHowever, the corresponding messages were not placed in LocalStrings.properties, \nso errors occur when attempting to fetch the text. Under JDK 1.4, using the \njava.util.logging.Logger class, a message is printed, and no exception is \nthrown for the missing text. However, under 1.3, using the commons SimpleLog \nclass, an exception is thrown, which kills the main thread, resulting in the \nhang.\n\nI've added the following to the properties file:\n\nhttp11protocol.endpoint.pauseerror=Error pausing endpoint\nhttp11protocol.pause=Pausing Coyote HTTP/1.1 on port {0}\nhttp11protocol.endpoint.resumeerror=Error resuming endpoint\nhttp11protocol.resume=Resuming Coyote HTTP/1.1 on port {0}\n\nI suspect that there may be other missing message strings, since the \nLifeCycleException seems to be complaining about a similar problem. This may \nalso explain the recent spate of e-mails on the tomcat-user list about missing \nmessages in the 1.4 log.\n",

With 5.0.16, I'm able to shut down Tomcat successfully when it's \nrunning on either 1.3 or 1.4; with the 5.0.19 release, shutdown requests on 1.4 \noperate correctly, but fail with an exception on 1.3:\n\n[INFO] Http11Protocol - -http11protocol.pause\n[ERROR] Catalina - -Catalina.stop <LifecycleException:  Cannot find message \nassociated with key \ncoyoteConnector.protocolHandlerPauseFailed>LifecycleException:Cannot find \nmessage associated with key coyoteConnector.protocolHandlerPauseFailed\n        at org.apache.coyote.tomcat5.CoyoteConnector.pause\n(CoyoteConnector.java:1462)\n        at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardService.stop\n(StandardService.java:560)\n        at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardServer.stop\n(StandardServer.java:2379)\n        at org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina.stop(Catalina.java:643)\n        at org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina.start(Catalina.java:618)\n        at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Native Method)\n        at org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap.start(Bootstrap.java:297)\n        at org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap.main(Bootstrap.java:398)\n\nThe server then hangs, but can be terminated with platform-specific kills.\n\nThe above came from a Win2K box, but was first observed on a non-Windows \nplatform as well - our mainframe JVM, which is stuck on 1.3 for a while.\n\nThe real exception has unfortunately been masked by the LifecycleException, \nsince the pause() method caught the original one and threw the Lifecycle error.\n\nThis is 100% reproducible in a JDK 1.3 environment.\n\nThanks for taking a look.",
