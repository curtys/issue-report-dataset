The change log is the definitive source for matching bug fixes\nagainst releases.\n\n> Closed bugs must contain a fixed release comment or attribute.\nWhilst committers do endeavour to do this when they commit a fix, there is no\npolicy within the Tomcat project that states that this must occur.\n\n> Not everyone has the knowledge to drill down hundred of files in CVS to look for\n> some unknown comment. Thanks you for your comprehension.\nIt is not necessary to use the source repository (which, for the record, is now\nin SVN rather than CVS). Again, look at the change log. (Hint: look at the log\nfor 5.0.x rather than 5.5.x as this bug was fixed quite some time ago).",
