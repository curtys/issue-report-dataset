It is documented at http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/config/filter.html#Set_Character_Encoding_Filter\n\nUse of <filter-class>org.apache.catalina.filters.SetCharacterEncodingFilter</filter-class>\nhowever will fail with CastClassException in ApplicationFilterConfig.getFilter:209 as it does not implement javax.servlet.Filter\n\nThis problem is not present in the 6.0 branch as SetCharacterEncodingFilter \nimplements Filter there\n\nThis problem is not present in the 7.0 branch as SetCharacterEncodingFilter extends FilterBase there\n\nWorkaround: continue to use your own SetCharacterEncodingFilter that is based on the example in ./servletapi/jsr154/examples/WEB-INF/classes/filters/SetCharacterEncodingFilter.java instead of using the embedded one.",
