    "description": "We have a web app running under Tomcat 5.0.28. We wrote a ServletContextListener\nand configured it in the web.xml, and all works fine. Then one day we wanted to\ndisable the listener, so we commented it out in our web.xml. Tomcat then\nreloaded the app. Our listener got a contextDestroyed call, as expected, but\nthen it still received a contextInitialized when the app was re-started (we know\nthis because of some logging we do in the listener). So then we stopped and\nstarted the webapp, with the same result. The only way we could get the listener\nto go away was to re-start Tomcat itself.\n\nTo me this behaviour appears to violate the intent of the ServletContextListener\ninterface as well as the contract defined by the web.xml deployment descriptor.\nOn the practical side, having to restart Tomcat to disable a listener is not a\nviable solution in a production environment",
