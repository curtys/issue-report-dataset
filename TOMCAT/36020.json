    "description": "As discussed on tomcat-dev I contribute a patch for MemoryUserDatabase that:\n\n1) Logs a warning, if the persistance directory is not writeable (instead of an\nugly Exception)\n2) Implements an additional attribute \"readonly\" (default: false) that one can\nuse to not get the warning in cases, where it's clear, that the directory is not\nwriteable.\n\nThe patch does not include a changelog-Patch, because that changes too often.\nCVS Head and 5.5.10 is the same for all files with changes.\n\nThe Warn message is only contained in the english LocalString.properties. Anyone\nwho could do es/fr/ja ?\n\nI think, at the moment there is no documentation for Userdatabase, so no place\nto add \"readonly\" information. If I'm wrong, please correct me.\n\nI'll try to add the readonly info to admin too (later).\n\nLast question: the close() for the MemoryUserDatabase is never called,\nespecially not during shutdown of tomcat. Anyone with a good hint, where to look\nfor adding a hook to close MemoryUserDatabase during tomcat shutdown?",
