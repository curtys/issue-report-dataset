    "description": "Hi,\n\nI noticed that the minSpareThreads / maxSpareThreads settings do not work with\nthe AJP connector. To be more precise settings these values in the connector\nelement has no effect at all. Instead the default values for minSpareThreads /\nmaxSpareThreads are used for the ThreadPool. I had a look at the sources and\nnoticed that the appropriate setters are missing in\norg.apache.jk.common.ChannelSocket. As I do not have that in depth knowledge of\nthe code I am not sure if it was simply forgotten to implement or if having the\npossibiliy to change these settings via the configuration creates other\nproblems. But as the default values are used in the current situation I do not\nthink so.\nSo I created a small patch for this, which works fine for me. I will attach it\nto this report.\n\nBest regards\n\nR\u00fcdiger Pl\u00fcm",
