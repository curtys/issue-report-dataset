Actual result:\nThe page is rendered as [[[ % \\% <% ]]]\nExpected result: [[[ \\% \\\\% <% ]]] \n\n\nI agree that I do not see provisions for escaping single '%' in the JSP Spec.\nIn JSP.1.3.10.1 EBNF Grammar (in JSP 2.2 Spec) defines template text as\n[[[\nTemplateText ::= ( \u2018<\u2018 | \u2018${\u2018 | \u2018#{\u2018 )\n| ( TemplateChar* -\n( TemplateChar* ( \u2018<\u2018 | \u2018${\u2018 | \u2018#{\u2018 ) ) )\n\nTemplateChar ::= \u2018\\$\u2019\n| \u2018\\#\u2019\n| \u2018<\\%\u2019\n| Char\n[ vc : QuotedDollarMatched ]\n]]]\n\nThe \u2018<\\%\u2019 is explicitly mentioned, but not '\\%'.",
