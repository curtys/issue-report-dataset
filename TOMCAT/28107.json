    "description": "Cactus has a pretty slick feature in that its tasks can be defined very simply in your build.xml file.  \nHere's an example:\n\n        <taskdef resource=\"cactus.tasks\"\n            classpathref=\"cactus.classpath\"/>\n\nThis is because there is a \"cactus.tasks\" text file in its JAR file that defines all the tasks.  I've done \nsomething similar in my Tomcat Ant Tasks HowTo (http://raibledesigns.com/wiki/Wiki.jsp?\npage=TomcatAntTasks) - but it'd be much cleaner (and easier) if there was a tomcat.tasks file in \ncatalina-ant.jar.  \n\nThis bug is to (hopefully) inspire to make Tomcat's Ant integration easier and simpler.",
