Only with the HostConfig Listener the automatic restart logic \nworks.\n\nAlso fix: After restart StandardHost (stop/start) a second ErrorValve exist. \nNot nice. \n\nAnother thing: Admin Application can't reflect automatic changes.\n   I thing we must add a refresh button and build the tree again....\n\nPeter",
