Would this be of any assistance (and \nwould it expedite the creation of a 64-bit version)?\n\nRichard Mundell\n___________________________\nRichard Mundell\nThe Roberts Group\nMarket Data Expertise that FITS.\n+1 212 499 2680 x20 (office)\n+1 212 499 2681 (fax)\nrichard.mundell@trgrp.com\nwww.trgrp.com",

            "body": "I fought this bug too.  It is related to Windows Data Execution Prevention \n[DEP] and Data Object Model Component [DCOM] and well as most likely the +COM \nunder Component Services | Component Services | Computers | My Computer\n\nSecond, this as well as nVidia drivers may require installation as a service \nfrom the command:\n\n\"<drive>:\\<ServerRoot>\\Apache2\\bin\\Apache.exe\" -k install -n \"Apache2\" -k\n\nand to run:\n\n<drive>:\\<ServerRoot>\\Apache2\\bin\\Apache.exe -w -n \"Apache2\" -k start\n\nGenerally, I've worked around the bug this way.  It seems to be in the \ninstaller's failure to know how to set up permissions properly.\n\ncgi won't run, MySQL won't work, PHP won't work, and most forum software won't \nwork because of this.\n\nOther programs also will not work, including the nVidia Firewall Network Access \nManager [NAM] and others crucial to services.\n\nThe truth of it is that the packagers are not familiar with the Execution Bit \nand Code Segment Tag Bits utilized in DEP and 64-bit systems.\n\nApache 2.0.47 installs and works on Windows Server 2003 (R2), even though it is \na 32-bit application and service.  I believe when Apache fixed some reported \ncgi bug they broke the install and execution, simply because Apache 2.0.47 \ndoesn't have this problem out of the box on 64-bit systems.  I wish they'd keep \naccess to earlier version around and that they'd fix this fix for an exploit \nthat was reported as possible yet one which no one had attempted.\n\nThe packagers should actually try it on a dry install of a 64-bit system before \nthey release the patches and finalize the beta testing!\n",
