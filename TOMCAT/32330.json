    "description": "In JspC the context classloader is set (initClassLoader() in processFile()), but\nnever reset to the original. This may cause serious (and hard to find ;-))\nclassloader trouble when JspC is used as an Ant task. For example, in my case\nant crashes during an xdoclet task (!) that is executed after the jspc task with\nthe following message: Class org.apache.commons.logging.impl.Jdk14Logger does\nnot implement Log.\n\nI think the fix is fairly simple: just set back the original classloader after\nJspC is done - that is, for me this works fine. I'll attach a patch.\n\nPeter Doornbosch\nLuminis - The Art of Software Engineering\nweb: http://www.luminis.nl",
