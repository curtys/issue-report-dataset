I hope you don't expect\neveryone to sift through the HEAD and every possible discussion on dev where its\noften not even clear exactly what things are being implemented.  I did some\nsearches on the lists for alias and manager and got lots of hits.  I read\nthrough a reasonable number of these without locating any resolution so I opened\na bug.  Please excuse.\n\nGerry Reno\n\n\n",
