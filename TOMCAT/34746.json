    "description": "When specifying an explicit jat file path name in the shared.loader\nproperty of catalina.properties file, the jar file is not loaded.\n\nThe problem occurs between the Bootstrap.createClassLoader method\nand the StandardClassLoader.addRepositoryInternal method.\nIn the form method, a File instance is created in which the\npath name has a File.separator appended.  This occurs only if\nthe resource path ends with \".jar\" and does not end with \"*.jar\".\nIn the latter method, the pathname in the File instance passed\nin the \"unpacked\" parameter is checked to see if it ends with\nthe \"/\" character.  If so, it is not opened and its manifest\nis not added to the opened Jars.\n\nTo workaround, simply make the explicit jar file pathname a\nURL; that is, prefix its path with \"file:\" in the shared.loader\nproperty in catalina.properties.",
