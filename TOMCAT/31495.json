    "description": "A functioning clustered application works fine when the tomcat server is\ninitially started.  Sessions are replicated, etc.\n\nAs soon as the context is reloaded on one server, the sessions are no longer\nreplicated between servers.  A full tomcat restart is required to restore this\nfunctionality.\n\nThe application and configuration are known to be functional, and the problem\ndoes not occur on 5.0.25.  The problem only occurs on our 5.0.28 installation. \nWe have downgraded our installation to verify this, and the same functionality\nthat does not work properly on 5.0.28 does in fact work on 5.0.25.\n\nThere is a thread with the subject of \"Clustering and session replication\" in\nthe tomcat-users mailing list, starting on 9/29/2004.\n\nAll relevant output is below:\n--Host \"A\" catalina.out from context reload--\nSep 29, 2004 3:47:26 PM org.apache.catalina.cluster.session.DeltaManager\nstart\nWARNING: Manager[/nahrgisdev], requesting session state from\norg.apache.catalina.cluster.mcast.McastMember[tcp://10.0.0.2:4001,\n10.0.0.2,4001, alive=253140].
