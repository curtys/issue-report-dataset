(I added it myself as I was having\nproblems with PHP CGI....I made it so under certain circumstances, it will use\n\"php\" instead of \"perl\" as the cgiexecutable and lo-and-behold, it\nworks...though I also had to add the env \"SCRIPT_FILENAME\" [which is just a\nexact copy of \"X_TOMCAT_SCRIPT_PATH\"] ).  I plan to make the php \"enhancement\"\nas a part of the init-param so it can be turned on or off as need be (as well as\nbe able to define what constitutes \"PHP\" mode...as right now, it's hard-coded to\nlook for commands that end with \".php\" \".php3\" \".php4\" \".phps\")\n\nanyways..maybe a regex for removing the trailing '/' might do...\n\n(In reply to comment #2)\n> This is likely a configuration issue.

And removing the extra File.separator from webAppRootDir\nwill result in a different String related exception elsewhere.\n\nAnd here's a fix that works:\n\ncginame = (currentLocation.getParent() + \nFile.separator).substring(webAppRootDir.length()) + name;\n\n(If necessary, the fix can be made more adaptive by checking to see if it really\ndoes have a File.separator at the end and if not...add it...otherwise, let it\nbe, etc.)\n\n(on a side note, I have one more bug to fix; the ENV_VAR \"SCRIPT_FILENAME\" isn't\ndefined as it should be [required for PHP4/5] but I'll submit a different\nbug/fix for that.)",
