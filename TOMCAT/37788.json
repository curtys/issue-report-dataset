I'd like to commit this.\n\nI seemed to remember that changing APR_INET -> APR_UNSPEC was my first attempt\nto get the AprEndpoint to listen on IPv6 addresses, and that I dropped it in\nfavour of APR_INET6 for some reason.\nI just did try APR_UNSPEC again and the JVM crashed on starting up tomcat - so\nthis is obviously the reason I had forgotten about. If the HotSpot error log the\nJVM writes is of any interest to you, just say so and I'll attach it.\n\nSystem spec:\nGentoo Linux with kernel 2.6.15-gentoo-r1\nSun JDK 1.5.0.06\nAPR 1.2.2\ntomcat-native-1.1.1\ngcc 3.4.4\nTomcat built today (Jan 28th 2006) from svn\n",

    "description": "On an IPv6-enabled host the normal Java Connectors will bind to the IPv6\nunspecified address ::0 (if no address is configured for the Connector element).\nOTOH APR Connectors will bind only to the IPv4 unspecified address 0.0.0.0 -\neven on an IPv6-enabled host. IMO it shouldn't depend on the type of connector\nused to which address(-family) Tomcat binds. Therefore I propose to use\nAPR_INET6 instead of APR_INET as address family when creating the APR endpoint.\nSince I'm in no way familiar with the Tomcat source, I'm not sure if the trivial\nchange I made to org.apache.tomcat.util.net.AprEndpoint is the right thing at\nthe right place. What I can say after trying out the so-patched Tomcat is the\nfollowing:\n- On an IPv6-enabled Linux host, Tomcat's APR Connector bound to ::0.\n- On an IPv4-only Linux host and an IPv4-only Windows XP host, Tomcat still\nworked (binding to 0.0.0.0 obviously).",
