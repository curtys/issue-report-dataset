This has been using an in-house version of the AJP client (webserver-side).\n\nOur symptoms were the same, and we had been working around by disabling connection sharing across requests.\n\nFollowing James' advice, I've removed the possibility for a servlet-side read from the request after the response has been closed. This has resolved the issue of us.",

    "description": "If a servlet (probably incorrectly) closes the writer/outputstream of a response, and then attempts to read from the request, the AJP connector sends GET BODY CHUNK to the mod_jk worker.\n\nThis then starts a series of very confusing communication between the worker and tomcat.  The worker doesn't read it until it makes its next request.  After making its next request, it reads it, and then sends a response with 0 length.  At the same time, Tomcat responds to the request made by the worker with another GET BODY CHUNK, which the worker also responds with a message of 0 length.  Then the really weird thing happens, Tomcat replays the first request made by that worker.  At this point, based on what I'm looking at with tcpdump, I get too confused to work out exactly what is happening.",
