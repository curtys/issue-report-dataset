    "description": "FormAuthenticator.authenticate() can send the client an error response with Japanese characters.  For example:\n\n            response.sendError(HttpServletResponse.SC_REQUEST_TIMEOUT,\n                               sm.getString(\"authenticator.sessionExpired\"));\n\nThis deviates from the HTTP RFC.  From http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec6.html#sec6.1.1:\n\nReason-Phrase  = *<TEXT, excluding CR, LF>\n\n\ufeffThe TEXT rule is only used for descriptive field contents and values\n   that are not intended to be interpreted by the message parser. Words\n   of *TEXT MAY contain characters from character sets other than ISO-\n   8859-1 [22] only when encoded according to the rules of RFC 2047\n   [14].\n\nThis can cause some problems with some clients.  For example, httpclient 3 reads the HTTP status line by looping over the line byte-by-byte, looking for the \"\\n\" byte.  The authenticator.sessionExpired Japanese string happens to contain a Japanese character for which one of the bytes matches \"\\n\", breaking this logic.",
