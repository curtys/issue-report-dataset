    "description": "Original Text:\nAny web application archive file that does not have a corresponding directory of\nthe same name (without the \".war\" extension) will be automatically expanded,\nunless the unpackWARs property is set to false. If you redeploy an updated WAR\nfile, be sure to delete the expanded directory when restarting Tomcat, so that\nthe updated WAR file will be re-expanded (note that the auto deployer will\nautomatically take care of this if it is enabled).\n\nAmbiguity:\nDoes the auto-deployer take care of the reexpansion, or the deleting of the\npreviously expanded directory?  In practice, it seems to be the former (meaning\nyou have to delete the dir, and autoDeploy will reexpand the new war for you),\nbut this passage could also be interpretted as: autoDeploy will check the date\nof the war vs what is already expanded and re-expand as necessary (it doesn't).\n\nI recommend:\n\"(note that the auto deployer will automatically expand the updated WAR file\nonce the previously expanded directory is removed).\"",
