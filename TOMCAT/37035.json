    "description": "If a user:\n\n - is on Windows\n - downloads the tar.gz distribution\n - unpacks with WinZIP\n\nthen Tomcat breaks in odd ways. This is because the temp\\ directory is empty in\nthe distribution, and WinZIP's default behaviour is not to create directories if\nthey are empty.\n\nI know this is a combination of WinZIP stupidity and odd user behaviour, but\nthere is an easy way to avoid the problem: add a temp\\README.txt file so the\ndirectory is non-empty.\n\nThere was a temp\\README.txt in 4.1 days, which read:\n\n\"\"\"\nThis temp directory is used by the JVM for temporary file storage.\nThe JVM is configured to use this as its java.io.tmpdir in the\ncatalina.sh and catalina.bat scripts.  Tomcat is configured to use\nthis temporary directory rather than its default for security reasons.\nThe temp directory must exist for Tomcat to work correctly.\n\"\"\"",
