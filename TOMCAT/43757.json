Can you provide a simple JSP that\n> exhibits this problem?\n\nGreetings Mark :)\n\nHere is a .jsp that should allow you to reproduce the issue:\n\n=========================\n\n<%@page contentType=\"text/html\"%>\n<%@page pageEncoding=\"UTF-8\"%>\n<%@page import=\"java.util.*\"%>\n<%@page import=\"javax.servlet.*\"%>\n<%\n\n\nServletContext context = this.getServletContext();\n\n\n\n// if (session.getAttribute(\"isAuth\") == null) {\n//     session.setAttribute(\"messageToUser\",\"Authentication failed.\");\n//        you.shouldNotParseThis();\n//     response.sendRedirect(\"./index.jsp\");\n// }\n\n// if (session.getAttribute(\"isAuth\") != null) {\n//     if (!session.getAttribute(\"isAuth\").toString().equals(\"true\")) {\n//        session.setAttribute(\"messageToUser\",\"Authentication failed.\");\n//         response.sendRedirect(\"./index.jsp\");\n//     }\n// }\n\nString state = \"\";\n\nif (request.getParameter(\"state\") != null) {\n    state = request.getParameter(\"state\");\n} else {\n    response.sendRedirect(\"./index.jsp\");\n}\n\n// each state is caught by name, final fall through goes back to index.jsp\nif (state.equals(\"CRInput\")) {\n    response.sendRedirect(\"./crinput.jsp\");\n} else {\n    response.sendRedirect(\"./index.jsp\");\n}\n\n\n%>\n\n==============================\n\nThere is actually a logical flaw with this (possible for two\nresponse.sendRedirect calls), and that is the root cause of the exception... my\nbad! But, the HTTP 500 response incorrectly points to the line number of the\nfirst occurrence of response.sendRedirect, whether it is commented out or not.\nThis makes debugging quite a pain.\n\nWith my recent discovery of the cause of the exception I feel that I set the\nseverity of this a bit high. I was not sure if it was my place to correct it, so\ndemote away if you'd like.\n\nThank you for the swift response!",
