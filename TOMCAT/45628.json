    "description": "Deploying webapps that contain commons-attributes-api.jar or commons-attributes-compiler.jar (downloaded from the Maven repository) fail with a message from ExtensionValidator along the lines of 'Required extension \"ant\" not found'. \n\nThis happens because the MANIFEST.MF file in these jars contain wrapped lines. Per the JAR spec, lines longer than 72 bytes have to wrap. These MANIFEST.MF files contain lines like:\n\nant-Implementation-URL: http://www.ibiblio.org/maven/ant/jars/ant-1.5.\n jar\n\nwhich evidently cause ExtensionValidator to complain. If you edit the MANIFEST.MF files to eliminate the continuation line:\n\nant-Implementation-URL: http://www.ibiblio.org/maven/ant/jars/ant-1.5.jar\n\nthere are no errors.",
