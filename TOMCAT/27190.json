Maybe there could be a check for\nthe request method in CoyoteAdapter.postParseRequest to prevent the redirect for\nCOPY and MOVE methods. Maybe there is the possibility of creating an xml\nattribute for the coyote connector which lets you specify which methods should\nnot do redirects with a default value to \"\". But I am not sure if it is easy to\nget the configuration settings for the coyote connector from this method.\n",

If you use MOVE /webdav/col/ everything works fine.\n\nThis is the reason why there is the redirect-carefully special environment\nvariable within Apache\nas this problem is known with many webdav clients (see also\nhttp://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/env.html#special).\n\nThe actual redirect is created in the lines 753 - 767 of\n\norg/apache/tomcat/util/http/mapper/Mapper.java\n\nwhich creates this redirect long before the WebDAVServlet has a chance to handle\nthis situation on its own.\nAnd now I am a little helpless how to fix this :-).\n\n\nRegards\n\nR\u00fcdiger Pl\u00fcm",
