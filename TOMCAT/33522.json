I didn't catch your previous comment.\n\nOn this page\nhttp://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-5.5-doc/printer/jasper-howto.html there\nis text:\n\n\"Apache Ant, which was used in previous Tomcat releases, can be used instead\ninstead of the new compiler by simply removing the\ncommon/lib/jasper-compiler-jdt.jar file, and placing the ant.jar file from the\nlatest Ant distribution in the common/lib folder. \"\n\nI think, that this is not problem in documentation, because on windows machine\nit works. The problem is in the setclasspath.sh.\n\nMy problem is, that we bundle the tomcat with Netbeans IDE and we want to use\nAnt base compiler. ",
