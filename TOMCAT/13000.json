    "description": "stephanie.bodoff@sun.com writes:\n\nI'm experimenting with tag files and believe I have found a bug. Here's \nmy tag file (simplified for debugging):\n\n<%@ attribute name=\"books\" required=\"true\" rtexprvalue=\"true\" \ntype=\"java.util.Collection\" %>\n<%@ attribute name=\"color\" required=\"true\" %>\n\n${color}\n${books.numberOfBooks}\n\nI'm passing a collection for the books attribute. However, I'm getting \nJSP exception (and not a very helpful one at that) when the tag is \nexecuted because the tag handler generated from the tag file is \nincorrect- the type of the books attribute is set to String instead of \nCollection. Is this a bug that has been fixed that I haven't picked up \nor is it a new one?",
