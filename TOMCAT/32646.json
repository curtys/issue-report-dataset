After restart realm login works for a while\nthen it stops working and logs the same message.\n\nNow I migrated to datasource realm, and it seems login works now, but only if I\nsetup DBCP to recover abandoned connections. Specifically, this happened:\n\nFirst I setup the datasource using the default parameters recommended in the\ntomcat-5.5-doc/jndi-datasource-examples-howto.html document, but with\nmaxActive=\"3\" maxIdle=\"1\". In thic case the first login was sucessful, the\nsecond (if I remember well) was failed. The log entry was this:\n\"SEVERE: Exception performing authentication\norg.apache.tomcat.dbcp.dbcp.SQLNestedException: Cannot get a connection, pool\nexhausted...\nCaused by: java.util.NoSuchElementException: Timeout waiting for idle object\"\n\nNext I switched on abandoned resource removal (using removeAbandoned=\"true\"\nremoveAbandonedTimeout=\"5\" logAbandoned=\"true\").\nIn this case the following appears in the log after each (successful) login\nattempts:\nDBCP object created 2005-01-12 20:37:09 by the following code was never closed:\njava.lang.Exception\n\tat\norg.apache.tomcat.dbcp.dbcp.AbandonedTrace.setStackTrace(AbandonedTrace.java:157)\n\tat\norg.apache.tomcat.dbcp.dbcp.AbandonedObjectPool.borrowObject(AbandonedObjectPool.java:76)\n\tat\norg.apache.tomcat.dbcp.dbcp.PoolingDataSource.getConnection(PoolingDataSource.java:95)\n\tat\norg.apache.tomcat.dbcp.dbcp.BasicDataSource.getConnection(BasicDataSource.java:540)\n\tat org.apache.catalina.realm.DataSourceRealm.open(DataSourceRealm.java:407)\n\tat org.apache.catalina.realm.DataSourceRealm.getRoles(DataSourceRealm.java:538)\n\tat org.apache.catalina.realm.DataSourceRealm.authenticate(DataSourceRealm.java:360)\n\tat org.apache.catalina.realm.DataSourceRealm.authenticate(DataSourceRealm.java:284)\n\tat\norg.apache.catalina.authenticator.BasicAuthenticator.authenticate(BasicAuthenticator.java:181)\n\tat\norg.apache.catalina.authenticator.AuthenticatorBase.invoke(AuthenticatorBase.java:446)\n",

I've also looked over\nthe DataSourceRealm.java code, and it clearly looks like everywhere open is\ncalled, if the connection returned is not null, it's closed in a finally block\nas it should be.  Please try 5.5.9 when it comes out (probably this weekend) or\nbuilding from HEAD if you don't feel like waiting until the weekend to try it out.\n\nI haven't looked at JDBCRealm.  As Remy suggested previously, DataSourceRealm is\nbetter and recommended.\n\nFinally: if you still get this behavior with 5.5.9, and reopen this issue,\nplease let us know what JDK you're using.  Also what DB version and driver, and\nif the behavior is reproducible with other DBs or drivers.",
