It is a\ntranslation- time error to name different encodings in the pageEncoding\nattribute of the page directive of a JSP page and in a JSP configuration element\nwhose URL pattern matches the page.\n- The charset value of the contentType attribute of the page directive. This is\nused to determine the page character encoding if neither a JSP configuration\nelement page-encoding nor the pageEncoding attribute are provided.\n- If none of the above is provided, ISO-8859-1 is used as the default character\nencoding.\n\n\n\n\nAppendix JSP.D\nPage Encoding Detection\n....\n\n3. If the file is a JSP page in standard syntax, use these steps. \n\na. Check whether there is a JSP configuration element <page-encoding> whose URL\npattern matches this file. \n\nb. Read the file using the initial encoding and search for a pageEncoding\nattribute in a page declaration. The specification requires the attribute to be\nfound only if it is not preceded by non-ASCII characters, so simplified\nimplementations are allowed. \n\nc. Report an error if there are a <page-encoding> configuration element whose\nURL pattern matches this file and a pageEncoding attribute, and the two name\ndifferent encodings. \n\nd. If there is a <page-encoding> configuration element whose URL pattern matches\nthis file, the page character encoding is the one named in this element. \n\ne. Otherwise, if there is a pageEncoding attribute, the page character encoding\nis the one named in this attribute. \n\nf. Otherwise, read the file using the initial encoding and search for a charset\nvalue within a contentType attribute in a page declaration.

The\nspecification requires the attribute to be found only if it is not preceded by\nnon-ASCII characters, so simplified implementations are allowed. \n\ng.
