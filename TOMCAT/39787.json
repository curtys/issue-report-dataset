When\nstarted as an application (tomcat5.exe) everything works fine.\n\nIt was first installed with the Windows installer version. I have updated the\nclass files from the .zip version as recommended by other error reports.  The\nprevious verion (5.5.12) worked ok.\n\nP.S. Not sure its relavant, but the host computer has multiple NIC's, cable and\nfibre, with the cable NIC disabled and the fibre NIC enabled.",
