            "body": "This isn't working correctly.  However I think the examples given so far have been incomplete.  I will try \nto give a full example.\n\nLets suppose we have two traditional custom tags, for this example I'm going to use the Spring 2.0 \nform tag libraries as they are the ones that led me here.\n\nThe first tag is form:form tag, which sets up context to be accessed by nested tags via the setParent \nmechanism.\n\nThe second tag is form:label tag, which makes use of the context created by the form:form tag and only \nfunctions properly when nested within a form:form tag.\n\nSo we might have an example jsp as follows.\n\n<form:form> \n  <form:label>hello</form:label>\n</form:form>\n\nthe generated java file for this jsp would invoke setParent(null) on the form:form tag and would invoke \nsetParent([reference to the form tag]) on the label tag.  This would be correct.\n\nNow let us assume that we create a tag file which makes use of the form:label tag because we tired of \ntyping \"Hello\" everywhere.\n\nOur tag file might look like this.\n\n<form:label>Hello</form:label>\n\nand our revised jsp page would look like this.\n\n<form:form>\n  <mycustumtag/>\n</form:form>\n\nIn this case the form:form tag would again get a setParent invoked with null, (still correct) and \nmycustomtag would get it's setParent invoked with the reference to the form:form tag, (also still \ncorrect), but the form:label tag inside of mycustomtag would get it's setParent method invoked with \n\"null\".  This is \"Not Correct\".  The label tag is nested inside of an outer tag and should have it's \nsetParent method invoked with the reference to that outer tag.\n\nHere is the logic I would propose for this section of code.\n\nif (myParent == null) {\n  // set parent of any top level tags used in tag file to null\n} else {\n  // set parent of any top level tags used in tag file to \"this\"\n}\n",

The fix will be in\n5.5.20 onwards.",

    "description": "Hi, everybody.\n\nSuppose I have a tag file (.tagx to be precise). I have some custom tags of mine \nincluded in that tag file. If I override setParent() in such a custom tag, then \nI see, that it's invoked with \"null\" parameter. Custom tag is a \"Classic\" tag \n(extends TagSupport).\n\nSimplified example: This tag file is called \"submit.tagx\"\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<jsp:root xmlns:jsp=\"http://java.sun.com/JSP/Page\" xmlns:custom=\"http://my.com/\ntags-html\" version=\"2.0\" >\n\n    <jsp:directive.tag body-content=\"empty\"/>\n    <jsp:directive.attribute name=\"action\" required=\"true\" rtexprvalue=\"true\"/>\n    <jsp:directive.attribute name=\"label\" required=\"true\" rtexprvalue=\"true\"/>\n\n    <custom:submit action=\"${action}\" label=\"${label}\" name=\"submitButton\" />\n\n</jsp:root>\n\nIn debug output from setParent(Tag) of custom:submit I see, that it's called \nwith \"null\" value.\n\nIf, instead of custom:submit, I put there another custom tag, which follows \nSimpleTagSupport model, then setParent(JspTag) is not called at all!!!\n\nI would expect a reference to something, representing translated class of Tag \nFile (submit.tagx) is passed.\n\nAs the result, tag nesting tree is broken. \n\nI need to access Struts html:form tag, which is the embracing tag from my inner \n<custom:submit> tag to obtain form name, but this is not possible.\n\n<nested:form action=\"/Action\">\n   <ctrl:submit action=\"save\" label=\"Save\"/>\n</nested:form>\n\n(where ctrl:submit is submit.tagx)",
