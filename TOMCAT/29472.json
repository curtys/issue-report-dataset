Worthwhile to consider Embedded to invoke appropriately\nsuper.start().\n\nSimilarly for stop().",

    "description": "The problem I am having relates to the Embedded class.\n\nIt centers around the problem that 'connectors' is a private variable\nin the class, and there is no overriding of 'findConnectors' (which\nis defined in StandardService).\n\nTherefore, findConnectors() on Embedded returns a value related to its\nsuperclass (StandardService) own (private) connectors[] variable, while\nthe class manages its own private list. \n\n-- \n\nA possible solution would be to:\n\n    - remove connectors private definition from Embedded\n    - make connectors in StandardService 'protected'\n\n-- \n\nI understand that one would not expect to query connectors when using\nEmbedded. However, in the context I am using, I have variants that may\nuse either Embedded, or Catalina (or a modification of Catalina/Bootstrap\nthat I have developed).",
