Most if not all serious jvm have correct priorities.)\n\nThere are plenty of JVMs out there that do correctly implements priority.\nAnd thrust me, it works. Here are some examples.\nPlease verify by yourself.\n\n-screen updater toggles back and forth between prio 4 and 6. It help propmptness\nof drawing.\n\n-finalizer has low prio, for obvious reason. It does run seldomly, as expected\nin idle times.\n\n-SEDA architecture like sandstorm works great!\nI myself created a seda thread manager based on priority and load detection. It\nruns very nicely on sun, ibm, jrockit JVM, on both win32 and linux platform.\n\nBesides, I raise the tomcat connector threads in a dirty way: enumerate thread,\nmatch name with regex, and raise prio to 7 (because I use prio 1 to 6 for\nsandstorm).\n\nTrust me, it really balances stage & queue load and work well. And with that\ntomcat prio raised, my web UI is responsive and I keep the control.\n\nIn other systems, with jmx timer and with container sheduling\nJSR 236 titled \"Timer for Application Servers\"\nhttp://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=236\nthread priority will become a serious concern.\n\nPlease consider this RFE with \"normal priority\" (hehehe!)",
