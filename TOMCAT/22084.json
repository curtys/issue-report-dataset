    "description": "If the text in a TemplateText node ends in \"\\n\", then if the mappedfile init \nparameter is set to true, or the line length exceeds CHUNKSIZE, the first line \nof Java code generated from the succeeding node will be indented too far.\n\nThe problem is that when visit(Node.TemplateText n) in Generator.java sees \nthe \"\\n\", it finishes the current line, and then calls out.printin() in order \nto properly indent the text that follows.  This works fine if there is text \nthat follows, but if there isn't, the effect is to overindent the first line \nin whatever code is generated by the next node to be visited.\n\nI will attach a patch that fixes this.",
