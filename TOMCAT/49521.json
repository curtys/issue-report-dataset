    "description": "There is a feature in org.apache.jk.server.JkCoyoteHandler implementation of AJP/1.3 protocol: when connector fails to bind to the specified port, it does not fail immediately but will try next available port number.\n\nThis was previously discussed in the following threads:\nhttp://marc.info/?t=126402175600004&r=1&w=2\nhttp://marc.info/?t=119266320200003&r=1&w=2\n\nThis feature is implemented in the org.apache.jk.common.ChannelSocket and ChannelNioSocket classes and can be controlled by setting channelSocket.maxPort property on a <Connector/>, but there is a bug:\n\nChannelSocket#setPort(int) resets the value of maxPort, and thus the final configuration is dependent on the order in which the XML attributes were processed.\n\n\nThis concerns only JkCoyoteHandler implementation of the protocol, present in Tomcat 5.5 and 6.0. The new AjpProtocol implementation present in 6.0 and used by default in Tomcat 7.0, as well AjpAprProtocol are not affected.",
