It should be clarified though that one \n*should* use the elipse workspace as ${tomcat.source}. I found the \nsentence 'Unless you thought ahead to make the ${tomcat.source} directory be \nunder your Workspace folder...' rather confusing. -> Move that sentence to the \ntop of the section, and make clear that ${tomcat.source} should be == Workspace \nfolder.",
