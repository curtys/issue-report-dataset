Thanx Flilip!\n\nAfter I have reconfigure my cluster to Tomcat 5.0.19 it works,\nbut I missing the save support and edit support at admin app.\n\nOk. I have made some changes and now the StandardServer implementation can \nsave also the new cluster configuration. :-) \n\nBut one problem I can't solve. The cluster is a module and the StandardServer\nclass is a core class. With my cluster config patch the compiling dependency\nbetween core classes and the later compile module classes are \nwrong!  :-(  \n  Only chance : comment it out the first compiling run !!!\n\nI hope one you have a good idea to solve these modules configuration issue.\n\nPeter\n\nPS: When you need help to add cluster config to Admin application\n    I can do the job.",
