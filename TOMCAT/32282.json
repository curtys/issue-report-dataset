    "description": "Tomcat just played a nice trick on me and wired out my webapps/root directory\nfull of years' worth of digital photography with no recent backups. I am not amused.\n\nI was simply trying to upgrade from Tomcat 5.5.1 to 5.5.4 so I uninstalled\n5.5.1, it prompted me whether I wished to remove the entire directory, I hit NO\nbecause I knew I had made modifications since installation but I guess it\n*assumed* webapps/root was unmodified and wiped it out.\n\nGuys, you should really fix this sort of thing. Either do a simple check to see\nwhether webapps/root has been modified or don't delete anything inside webapps\nto begin with. Please! I'm setting this issue to a higher priority because it\ninvolved data loss.",
