It should be included.  Something like:\n\nConfiguration attribute values may use variable substitution (aka dynamic variable values or system property variable values).\n\nThe syntax for doing so is ${varname}\n\nValid variable names come from any system properties (JVM Option) that are available at the time.  Values are only resolved once and not updated until the server is restarted.",
