Thereafter, tests are\nmade in this fashion:\n\nif $os400; then\n\nThe same variable is also used in setclasspath.sh.  However, the test there is\n\nif [ ! \"$os400\" ]; then\n\nwhich will always evaluate to false, given that the variable is set.\n\nThe setclasspath.sh script can be modified to correct this faulty behavior by \nusing this form instead:\n\nif ! \"$os400\"; then\n\nAt the moment this problem prevents a user from starting Tomcat in debug mode.",
