Here are patches.\n\n- CompressionResponseStream should not compress the output stream if the\nresponse has been committed (because then it cannot write the Content-Encoding:\ngzip header, and the browser displays the compressed output as-is)\n- CompressionServletResponseWrapper causes a NullPointerException if you flush\nbefore writing anything",
