The zip file also includes the source code for the two servlets.\n To invoke the page on my default install of Tomcat, I use\nhttp://localhost:8080/bugtest/bugtest.html.\n\nI've tried several times to attach the zip file and the war file to this bug\nreport, but with no success.  Perhaps because I'm behind a firewall and a router\nusing NAT?",
