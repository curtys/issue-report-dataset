    "description": "When using org.apache.jasper.JspC as a taskdef Ant tag, if there is a failure \nin the compilation the whole compilation aborts.\n\nAlthough in some working environments it is required to stop the whole process \nafter the first error, there are cases where it is needed to have the whole \nlist of errors instead of stopping at the first one.\n\nA typical case is when migrating from WebLogic to JBoss. WebLogic's JSPC \nforgives so much that develpers do not notice they are entering faulty JSP \nexpressions. When compiling with Jasper for migration it is needed to be able \nto get all the errors to distribute the job among the developers.\n\nI recommend a \"failonerr\" capability to JspC and modify the unconditional re-\nthrow of exceptions catched by JspC.execute().",
