When\nusing the Apache Portable Runtime, the sendfile thread can take 100% CPU load\nwhen a poll descriptor time-out occurs. This happens because Poll.maintain() is\nnever called for the sendfile thread.\n\nThe proposed patch (http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=20930)\ncan also be applied to Tomcat 5.5.",
