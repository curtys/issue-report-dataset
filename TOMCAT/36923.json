    "description": "JavaServer Pages Specification 2.0, section JSP.3.3.2 says:\n---\nSince the syntactic pattern ${expr} was not reserved in the JSP specifications\nbefore JSP 2.0, there may be situations where such a pattern appears but the\nintention is not to activate EL expression evaluation but rather to pass through\nthe pattern verbatim. To address this, the EL evaluation machinery can be\ndeactivated as indicated in this section.\n[...]\nThe default mode for JSP pages in a Web Application delivered using a web.xml\nusing the Servlet 2.3 or earlier format is to ignore EL expressions; this\nprovides for backward compatibility.\n---\n\nHowever, even with deactivated EL expression evaluation, jsp code like:\n<%@ page isELIgnored=\"true\" %>${<%= \"Hello, world!\" %>}\n\nwill produce output like:\n${<%= \"Hello, world!\" %>}\n\nwhich is of course not backwards-compatible with Servlet 2.3 / JSP 1.2 container\n(e.g., Tomcat 4.x), where the output would be:\n${Hello, world!}\n\nThe ${...} syntax is widely used, and any pre-2.0 jsp pages having it would be\nincompatible with Tomcat 5.x even though the standard tries to ensure the\ncompatibility.",
