The main problem is this sentence: \"If at least one\n<jsp-propertygroup> contains the most specific matching URL pattern, the\nresource is considered to be a JSP file\". This is clearly extremely bad behavior\nwhen using wildcard patterns.\nI am going to veto any attempt to fix these last two \"bugs\" (with bug 27664)\nuntil I am explained why the specification is not broken.",

What's the difference between\nthese two?\n\nIf you include directories with the resources that match a url-pattern, this\nexplains bug 27664: a directory is then served as a JSP file, which can not be\nfound, resulting in a 404.\n\nHowever, JSP3.3 states: \"A JSP property group is a collection of properties that\napply to a set of files that represent JSP pages.\" Directories are apparently\nnot included in this definition.\n\nSRV9.10 states: \"The purpose of this mechanism is to allow the deployer to\nspecify an ordered list of partial URIs for the container to use for appending\nto URIs when there is a request for a URI that corresponds to a directory entry\nin the WAR not mapped to a Web component.\" Requests for a directory should\nresult in an attempt to append welcome files to this directory.",
