This is something we can discuss for the 1.7 release. \n\nBut in the meantime, there are people out there using the Ant project's jasper\nadapter, and that one builds a java command with the -vN option, where N is a\nverbosity metric. If that is all that has changed, can we please, please, please\nhave it back :)\n\nBTW, what other changes have there been that would break stuff? Just so we know\nwhat to expect in bugreps?",

    "description": "Hi,\n\nWe are getting reports coming in that the latest releases of jasper are breaking\nAnt's <jspc> task, because that sets the verbosity option for output control,\nand changes in the args are breaking things. See bugrep #25345 for details.\n\nI think the immediate fix for ant1.6.1 would be to not pass on verbosity info,\nbut   we are bound to keep getting many reports about the same break with 1.6.0\nand 1.5; so please can you bring back the old -v0 style of option, and make\nchanges to the command mechanism in a more backwards compatible way in future\n-where possible.\n\nTa,",
