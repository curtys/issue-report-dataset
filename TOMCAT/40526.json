    "description": "We have upgraded from tomcat 4.1.18 to 5.5.17, and have found that our \nsystem start up process on Windows can no longer set jpda debugger \noptions on the tomcat java command line.\n\nThis occurs because the 5.5.17 catalina.bat file no longer supports \nthe environment variable $JPDA_OPTS, which our start up process used \nto use to place jpda information. What is interesting is that \ncatalina.sh STILL supports JPDA_OPTS. So we have this problem on windows only.\n\nIs this an intentional change?\n\nThe above comment was sent to tomcate users list. Mark Thomas responded:\n\nNot that I can tell. If you care to create a patch and submit it to bugzilla \nI'll take a look.\n\nI have made the fix, and I am sending it for approval. I have a zip file with \nthe correction, and the output of a diff -u on the original and corrected \nversion of the catalina.bat and the catalina.sh scripts. I do not see on this \nbug entry page any place to attach this zip file. Please let me know how I can \nsend the changes to the community.\n\nBelow is a summary of changes made:\n\nChanges include revised catalina.sh and catalina.bat files supporting \nJPDA_OPTS (supported in tomcat 4.1.18), and support for a new JPDA_SUSPEND.\n\ncatalina.sh changes:\n\n1.
