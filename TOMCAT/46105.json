    "description": "How to reproduce bug.\n\nConfigure tomcat connector with URIEncoding=UTF-8 attribute.\nMake a simple page that write out any request parameter. Configure this page as protected with form-based authentication.\nTry to access page, e.g.\n\n/site/page.jsp?q=%xx%yy%zz%tt\n\nwhere q=%xx%yy%zz is value in UTF-8 charset.\n\nWhen page is being accessed for the first time, then after authentication, parameter \"q\" is incorrectly interpreted (it seems as it was in ISO8859-1 or anything else, but not UTF-8).\n\nBut subsequent access to the _same_ URI, i.e.\n/site/page.jsp?q=%xx%yy%zz%tt\n\ngives perfect result.\n\nI also tried useBobyEncodingForURI=true and request.setCharacterEncoding(\"UTF-8\") - nothing is changed.",
