I never said the above.\n\nThe issue here is that the 1.4 JVM that you are using does not implement a feature of \"unbound server sockets\" that the current code uses.\n\nLooking at Jdk14Compat.java that probably stems from\nhttp://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=778258\nthat apparently is a fix for\nhttps://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=45528\n\nwhich is about 1,5 years ago.\n\n\nI am attaching a patch (for the current tc5.5.x, as of 5.5.33) that will probably fix this issue.",
