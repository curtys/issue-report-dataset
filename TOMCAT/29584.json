    "description": "The JNDI documentation is not entirely clear as to the number of JNDI contexts \nand their relationship. I am reading the page entitled, \"JNDI Resources HOW-TO\".\n\nThe top of the page states that each web app receives a unique initial context. \nSo far, so good.\n\nThen, under 'Configuring JNDI Resources', the explanation talks about elements \nthat live inside either <Context> or <DefaultContext> in server.xml. \n\nFirst clarification: Since <Context> elements are frequently created in \nseparate files in the Catalina directory, this text should reference those \nfiles.\n\nSecond clarification issue: the page 'globalresources.html' explicitly states \nthat <Environment/> elements in the GlobalNamingResources propagate \nautomatically into each web application. To me, that implied that the other \nresources defined in GlobalNamingResources would also propagate. They don't, at \nleast in the 'custom factory' case. Under 'Resource Definitions', the text says \nthat you can declare the characteristics of resource-env-ref's for a web.xml in \nthe GlobalNamingResources. This may be true of the standard factories, but it \nis NOT true for custom factories. Unless that's deemed to be a defect, this \ntext should state, explicitly, that custom factories require a ResourceLink \nelement to make them available in the per-web-application InitialContext.\n\nBack to the JNDI howto.  \n\nThird clarification:\n\nThe initial reference to <ResourceLink> mentions the global JNDI context \nwithout referencing the GlobalNamingResources link. The terminology here is not \nquite consistent with the definition of 'Global Resources' below. It would be \nclearer to include an href to GlobalNamingResources in the <ResourceLink> \nbullet, since ResourceLink is (I think) only useful for GlobalNamingResources.\n\nFourth clarification: Under 'Adding Custom Resource Factories', the reference \nto conf/server.xml should be more specific. It should state that you have three \nchoices: <Context>, <DefaultContext>, or <GlobalNamingResources> with a \n<ResourceLink> to make it available in Context or DefaultContext. Possibly, the \nsame clarification is apropos for the standard resource factories, though the \nspecial cases for them in the source might render it unnecessary.",
