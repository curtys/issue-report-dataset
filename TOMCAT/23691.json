But the SMAP includes the LineInfo \"19:167,6\", which SMAPs line 19 of \nthe JSP to lines that don't exist in the generated servlet.\n\nTaking out the \"doVisit(n);\" line in Generator.java's \nGenBuffer.adjustJavaLines function seems to fix this, but I'm not going to \ncommit that change, as I don't understand the surrounding code fully.",
