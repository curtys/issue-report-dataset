I guess\nthis should be replaced by 'group'.\n\nPlus:\nWhy does the URL read tomcat-4.1 BTW if I browse the 5.0 documentation? Very\nconfusing.\nMore comprehensive examples of how to use the context property would be nice.\nAll in all documentation seems too fuzzy to me. It would definitely nice to have\ngood documentation on all the parameters of the JK2 configuration.\n\nCheers\n\nOrtwin Gl\u00fcck",
