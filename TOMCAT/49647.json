The latter is true, if it finds \"javax.activation.DataSource\" in activation.jar and \"javax.mail.Service\" in mail.jar. Both are not part of the download target, possibly because of licensing. So I guess they were not present on the build machine.\n\nWe need better release documentation for TC 5.5, release process seems to be to fragile. There are lots of other dynamically determined conditions in the build.xml files.",
