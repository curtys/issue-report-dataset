However I need to use my own taglib.\nIn the foo.tld file, the \"value\" attribute of \"set\" has rtexprvalue=true.\nIf I set this to false then the problem goes away. However I noticed that c.tld \nin standard.jar also has rtexprvalue=true for the \"value\" attribute of \"set\". \nWhy the difference in behaviour ? We also wish to have rtexprvalue=true.",
