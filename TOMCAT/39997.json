I can reproduce similar behaviour with and without the use of jsvc.\n\nI have ported the SSLRandomSeed configuration option from 6.0.x and that fixes this for me with and without jsvc. I'll attach a patch shortly.",

    "description": "I use jsvc started by root that forks to a process owned by tomcat user. The\nserver runs on port 80 and 443. Using jsvc works fine with apr for http (port\n80), but for https (port 443) it doesn't. Either it takes ages to run (as stated\nby more than one user on tomcat-users as we may see below) or it simply freezes:\n\nhttp://www.nabble.com/Http11AprProtocol-took-2-hr-to-init-on-http-443-tf1810268.html#a4950939\n\nIf we run http with apr protocol, but https as basic protocol, as suggested\nabove, it works perfectly.\n\nWhen using jsvc, we have a warning for the JDK, due to some permission problem:\n\nJava HotSpot(TM) Client VM warning: Can't detect initial thread stack location -\n find_vma failed\n\nAnd this seems to be a jsvc bug related to the lack of permission by the\nnon-admin user (in my case, tomcat), as we can see here:\n\nhttp://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=38633\n\nFor jvsc without apr, everything works fine. The same for apr without jvsc\n(running as root user). But SSL simply does not work for me when both are used.\n\nRunning \"kill -3 pid\" for the tomcat process returns the following stack trace:\n\n\"main\" prio=1 tid=0x08bc6f78 nid=0x966 runnable [0xbf8d4000..0xbf8d4e48]\n        at org.apache.tomcat.jni.SSL.initialize(Native Method)\n        at org.apache.tomcat.util.net.AprEndpoint.init(AprEndpoint.java:628)\n        at org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11AprProtocol.init(Http11AprProtocol.jav\na:115)\n        at org.apache.catalina.connector.Connector.initialize(Connector.java:101\n6)\n        at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardService.initialize(StandardService.j\nava:580)\n        - locked <0x891e1ce8> (a [Lorg.apache.catalina.connector.Connector;)\n        at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardServer.initialize(StandardServer.jav\na:791)\n        at org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina.load(Catalina.java:503)\n        at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\n        at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.\njava:39)\n        at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAcces\nsorImpl.java:25)\n        at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:585)\n        at org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap.load(Bootstrap.java:266)\n        at org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap.init(Bootstrap.java:281)\n        at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\n        at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.\njava:39)\n        at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAcces\nsorImpl.java:25)\n        at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:585)\n        at org.apache.commons.daemon.support.DaemonLoader.load(DaemonLoader.java\n:160)\n\nPlease tell me if you need further information.",
