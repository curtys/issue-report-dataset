The behaviour is in Tomcat 5.5.20, here is the\nfollowing exception :\norg.apache.jasper.JasperException: Tentative d''op\u00e9ration bean sur un objet nul.\norg.apache.jasper.runtime.JspRuntimeLibrary.handleGetProperty(JspRuntimeLibrary.java:601)\n\torg.apache.jsp.test3_005f2_jsp._jspService(test3_005f2_jsp.java:77)\n\nThis not the same bug as 37933. It is an error that is due to the bug correction\n:(. (well but the correction of the bug 37933 is not easy)\nI explain.\n\nI have a custom tag that defines a scripting variable. This variable is in a\nrequest attribute. The custom tag library defines a scripting variable with a\nTag Extra Info class. The TLD declares a tag with the tag class implementation\nand the Tag Extra Info class implementation.\nThe tag is named \"variable\".\nThe tag has 3 attributes \"id\", \"className\", \"scopeIn\".\n\nThe object \"Song\" has a property \"title\".\n\nHere is where it fails : \n<%@ taglib uri=\"http://www.scort.com/test\" prefix=\"test\" %> \n...\n<!-- The variable is set in the scope request -->\n<test:variable id=\"mysong\" className=\"tomcat.test.Song\" scopeIn=\"request\" />\n...\nTitle : <jsp:getProperty name=\"mysong\" property=\"title\" />\n\n=> mysong is said to be null\n\nBut here is a page where it works : \n<%@ taglib uri=\"http://www.scort.com/test\" prefix=\"test\" %> \n...\n<!-- The variable is set in the scope page -->\n<test:variable id=\"mysong\" className=\"tomcat.test.Song\" scopeIn=\"page\" />\n...\nTitle : <jsp:getProperty name=\"mysong\" property=\"title\" />\n\nFinally it always works with jsp:useBean :\n\n<jsp:useBean id=\"mysong\" class=\"tomcat.test.Song\" scope=\"request\" />\n...\nTitle : <jsp:getProperty name=\"mysong\" property=\"title\" />\n\n\nThe custom library i wrote defined a VariableInfo that expose a scripting\nvariable into the page. So i thought (think) it was the key to allow it into the\n jspGetProperty.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nReference in the specification JSP 2.0 JSP5.3 :\n\n\"The value of the name attribute in jsp:setProperty andjsp:getProperty will\nrefer to an object that is obtained from the pageContext object through its\nfindAttribute method.\"\n\nHope it helps.",

If you look at the changes made to GeneratorVisitor.visit(Node.GetProperty n), code was added to check if the varInfoNames Set contains the variable name used in the getProperty. If this variable name is not found, a JasperException is thrown. However, what I believe is missing is a check of the parent hierarchy to see if it was declared at a higher level. In the case I have an issue with, the jsp:getProperty does not have any varInfoNames declarations, but the parent (which is a customTag) does contain the proper declarations. The proper declaration would have been found if the check had traversed to the parent.",

I do have the necessary rights to distribute these files. \n\nSo it it sounds like you already have a fix in progress for the case I am referencing. Is there some other bug id this is associated with, or is it part of 38797 ? \n\nThe TLD location is an oversight, but apparently the tags are still being found.",
