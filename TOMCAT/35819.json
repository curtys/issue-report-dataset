    "description": "When an app is undeployed via the manager (that was previously deployed with the\nmanager), its associated work directory is not removed from Tomcat.  This is on\nWindows 2000, whether Tomcat is executed as a service OR from the command line.\n This can lead to stale JSPs being executed, among other things.\n\nLooking at the source code, it appears as though the work dir was *intended* to\nbe removed when the Context is destroyed.  The following patch to the 5.5.9 code\nbase seems to fix the problem:\n\n---\njakarta-tomcat-catalina/catalina/src/share/org/apache/catalina/startup/ContextConfig.java.orig\n2005-03-26 13:24:02.000000000 -0500\n+++\njakarta-tomcat-catalina/catalina/src/share/org/apache/catalina/startup/ContextConfig.java\n2005-07-15 15:00:36.156708000 -0400\n@@ -1240,7 +1240,7 @@\n         // Called from StandardContext.destroy()\n         if (log.isDebugEnabled())\n             log.debug(sm.getString(\"contextConfig.destroy\"));\n-        String workDir = ((StandardContext) context).getWorkDir();\n+        String workDir = ((StandardContext) context).getWorkPath();\n         if (workDir != null)\n             ExpandWar.delete(new File(workDir));\n     }",
