I don't see any deviations from RFC 2616 in my second HTTP/1.1 request (although the RFC is quite unspecific on OPTIONS method).\n",

    "description": "When an \"options\" http request is made to Tomcat to a directory that has no \ndefault file (like index.jsp) in it, Tomcat reports a full list of allowed \nverbs, when in fact, most of them are NOT allowed.  For example, a request to \na generic img directory:\n\nOPTIONS /img/ HTTP/1.0\n\tCookie: JSESSIONID=C46C2E18BE95AD91828C9370CBDF0AF2\n\tContent-Length: 0\n\tAccept: */*\n\tAccept-Language: en-us\n\tConnection: Keep-Alive\n\tUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; \nSV1; .NET CLR 1.1\n\t4322; InfoPath.1)\n\nReturns:\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nServer: Apache-Coyote/1.1\nAllow: GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, TRACE, OPTIONS\nContent-Length: 0\nDate: Mon, 24 Apr 2006 15:11:16 GMT\nConnection: close\n\nWhich shows several destructive options available (PUT, DELETE).  But a \nrequest to DELETE or PUT (correctly) returns a 403 FORBIDDEN result:\n\nDELETE /img/ HTTP/1.0\n\tCookie: JSESSIONID=C46C2E18BE95AD91828C9370CBDF0AF2\n\tContent-Length: 0\n\tAccept: */*\n\tAccept-Language: en-us\n\tConnection: Keep-Alive\n\tUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; \nSV1; .NET CLR 1.1\n\t4322; InfoPath.1)\n\nReturns:\nHTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden\nServer: Apache-Coyote/1.1\nContent-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8\nContent-Length: 964\nDate: Mon, 24 Apr 2006 15:12:31 GMT\nConnection: close\n\nBecause the initial OPTIONS request returns a list containing dangerous verbs, \nthe directory will be flagged as a serious security vulnerability by most \nscanners (a false positive).\n\nThe issue DOES NOT occur when the directory HAS a default file in it:\nOPTIONS /user_management/ HTTP/1.0\n\tCookie: JSESSIONID=C46C2E18BE95AD91828C9370CBDF0AF2\n\tContent-Length: 0\n\tAccept: */*\n\tAccept-Language: en-us\n\tConnection: Keep-Alive\n\tUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; \nSV1; .NET CLR 1.1\n\t4322; InfoPath.1)\n\nReturns:\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nServer: Apache-Coyote/1.1\nSet-Cookie: JSESSIONID=BC992F0C86E2BCBD0A2E5F1B3A12C50C; Path=/\nContent-Type: text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1\nDate: Mon, 24 Apr 2006 15:14:27 GMT\nConnection: close",
