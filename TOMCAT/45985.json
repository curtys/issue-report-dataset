In our product the url http://HOST/polarion  is changed to http://HOST/polarion/? and later http://HOST/polarion/?#/project/demo.\n\nThe fix is trivial, applicable also to Tomcat 6.\n\nIn CoyoteAdapter\n(http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomcat/trunk/java/org/apache/catalina/connector/CoyoteAdapter.java)\n\nchange \n\n            if (query != null) {\n                // This is not optimal, but as this is not very common, it\n                // shouldn't matter\n                redirectPath = redirectPath + \"?\" + query;\n            }\n\nto \n            if (query != null && query.length()>0) {\n                // This is not optimal, but as this is not very common, it\n                // shouldn't matter\n                redirectPath = redirectPath + \"?\" + query;\n            }\n\nTested on patched version apache-tomcat-5.5.16-embed and it works fine.",
