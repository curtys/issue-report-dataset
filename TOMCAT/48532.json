    "description": "When people try to set up SSL with Tomcat, most of them don't need client authentication and thus won't set the truststoreFile, truststorePass and etc. However, Tomcat (or rather, JSSESocketFactory) will always try to load the trust store. Somehow it got a valid path but the password (by default set to that for the keystore) is incorrect and will throw an exception like below. This is very\nconfusing as people will keep checking the password of their keystore (and\ndon't know anything about trust store).\n\nI'd recommend the following solutions (most preferred listed first):\n1) don't load the trust store if client authentication is false.\n2) if a trust store is not specified, use the keystore.\n3) the SSL howto should emphasize that a trust store must be set up.\n\nsample stack trace:\n\njava.io.IOException: Keystore was tampered with, or password was incorrect\n        at sun.security.provider.JavaKeyStore.engineLoad(JavaKeyStore.java:771)\n        at sun.security.provider.JavaKeyStore$JKS.engineLoad(JavaKeyStore.java:3\n8)\n        at java.security.KeyStore.load(KeyStore.java:1185)\n        at org.apache.tomcat.util.net.jsse.JSSESocketFactory.getStore(JSSESocket\nFactory.java:287)\n        at org.apache.tomcat.util.net.jsse.JSSESocketFactory.getTrustStore(JSSES\nocketFactory.java:261)\n        at org.apache.tomcat.util.net.jsse.JSSE14SocketFactory.getTrustManagers(\nJSSE14SocketFactory.java:175)\n        at org.apache.tomcat.util.net.jsse.JSSE15SocketFactory.getTrustManagers(\nJSSE15SocketFactory.java:69)",
