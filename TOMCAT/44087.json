    "description": "Using jboss 4.2.1 (based on tomcat 5.5), with tomcat-native-1.1.10 installed, \nand SSL enabled.  Connecting to port 8443 (https port) using netcat and then \ndisconnecting without sending any data will cause tomcat to handle a duplicate \ncopy of one of the recent requests.  For example, a client at 10.0.0.1 is \nmaking HTTP GET requests for https://someserver:8443/someurl?foo=1, with foo \nbeing incremented on each request.  If you connect to the https port from \n10.0.0.2 and then disconnect without sending any data, the access log will show \n10.0.0.2 issuing a request for someurl?foo=some_recent_number.",
