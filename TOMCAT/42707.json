I tried starting and stopping the host\nfrom within jmx, it didn't help, I tried Catalina/Server/Operations/storeConfig\nand starting and stopping the host and that didn't help either.\n\nI tested with the following versions for the server\njdk 1.6.0_01-b06\ntomcat 5.5.20, 6.0.10, 6.0.13\n\nfor the client I was using the jdk 1.6.0_01-b06 jconsole, as well as a custom\napplication I had written as well as the the \"administration web application 5.5.23\"\n\nall the combinations above had similar results.\n\nI will briefly mention that in tomcat 6.0.10/13 I was unable to save the\nconfiguration due to an error :\n   Jun 20, 2007 5:26:11 PM org.apache.catalina.core.StandardServer storeConfig\n   SEVERE: StoreConfig mbean not registeredCatalina:type=StoreConfig\nI will open a separate bug for that.\n\nIn tomcat 5 I was able to save the config.\n\nIf I restart tomcat5 after saving the config (using catalina.sh stop / start)\nthe new alias works properly. \n\nLikewise, if I edit the tomcat 6 conf/server.xml and add the alias entry in\nmanually and restart tomcat, the url http://test1.localdomain:8080/test/ works fine.\n\nSo, the main problem is that adding an alias dynamically doesn't seem to work.",
