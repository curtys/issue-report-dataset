    "description": "Make deployment of the manager application a configuration option when adding\nnew hosts.\n\nFix, and enhance the confirm dialog for actions on hosts. MessageFormat was\neating the single quote chars. Dialog now displays action and host name.\n\nMake the commands column no-wrap. If one host had a lot of aliases, then the\ncommand column cell would wrap, causing every row in the table to be double-height.\n\nLink in HostName field now goes to the host. Previously it would generate an\nunknown command.\n\nIf a host has no aliases, put a space in the cell so that the appearance is\nconsistent between all rows.",
