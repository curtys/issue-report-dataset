According to the comments on Bug \n33970, this fix was backported to 5.0. Will it be included in 5.0.30? I would \nprefer not to go to 5.5 yet as the java upgrade would be a major setback.\n\n",

    "description": "The scheme attribute for the default CoyoteConnector (which i believe is\norg.apache.coyote.tomcat4.CoyoteConnector) is not being recognized right away.\nRight away sounds ambiguous, and it is annoying.  But right after starting\nthe server, the scheme will be returned (request.getScheme()) will be returned\nas http instead of https.\n\nFor example, with a connector like\n    <Connector port=\"80\"\n               maxThreads=\"150\" minSpareThreads=\"25\" maxSpareThreads=\"75\"\n               enableLookups=\"false\" redirectPort=\"443\" acceptCount=\"100\"\n               debug=\"0\" connectionTimeout=\"20000\"\n               scheme=\"https\" secure=\"false\"\n               disableUploadTimeout=\"true\" />\n\nImmediately after starting tomcat running a jsp such as:\n<html><head></head><body>\ngetScheme=<%= request.getScheme() %>\n</body></html>\n\ngives the result of:\n<html><head></head><body>\ngetScheme=http\n</body></html>\n\nThat all is very reproducable.  The ambiguousness comes in later.  After letting\nthe server run for awhile, it'll start returning https as expected.  I have no\nconcrete data on \"awhile\".\n\nI have run into this problem with tomcat:\n 4.1.31 on AIX and Linux.\n 5.0.25 on AIX\n 5.5.4 on Linux\n\nThe tomcat-users list did not bite on this problem after I posted it last week,\nand I can't seem to find any reference to it in bugzilla.\n\nPlease contact me if you have any questions or are having difficulty reproducing.\n\nThanks,\n\nEric",
