            "body": "Well, Remy, just out of curiosity, when you consider a bug a bug? ;)\n> Avoid screwing up context.xml (and same with server.xml).\nIn a perfect world i'd agree with you, but in a large company where, who's\noperating (and sometimes configuring) the application servers are not the same\npeople who wrote the apps, to paraphrase a famous movie, \"I've seen things, you\nhumans can't even imagine...\":)\n\nAnyhow, i tried to look into the source and i saw that the problem is that the\napp gets registered in the deployed Map when indeed the Context has not been\nbuilt and there's no child with that name added to the host container.\nThis makes the app no longer neither deployable nor undeployable and makes\nTomcat behaving erratically at stop time.\nIf i didn't overlook something, in org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig should\nbe enough to check if the digester correctly built the Context and if has been\nadded as a child to the host container before registering it into the deployed Map.\nIn this case, the war deployer will have a chance later to try to deploy the app\nwar, but since the context.xml is screwed up, the app will be registered but\nwill remain stopped.\nThis will allow to undeploy and redeploy it without problems.\n\nObviously this will cause the context.xml to be parsed twice, and the log will\nshow twice the SAXException messages, but i don't think this should be a\nproblem, because now it is a recoverable and controlled situation.\n\nI'll attach a patch for this.",

    "description": "Tomcat 5.5.0-dev, Java 5, Win XP Pro SP2.\nI was hit by Bug 32729 so i've just downloaded source head from CVS and rebuilt\nthe distribution to test its solution, but i think there are still problems in\nthat area.\nConsider the following scenario (all using ant tasks):\n1- deploy a .war containing a META_INF/context.xml with syntax errors\n2- the .war is uploaded in webapps, the context.xml is extracted and copied in\nconf/Catalina/localhost, the application, as expected, is not correctly deployed\nand using list manager command it shows as stopped.\n3- stop and restart tomcat\n4- the application, as expected, won't deploy again, but this time it won't show\neither in list output and i cannot operate on it anymore.\n\nI mean that:\na- i cannot undeploy it because the context path does not exist\nb- i cannot deploy. Even if a correct .war is uploaded in webapps the deploy\ntask issue the following error:\nCannot find message associated with key managerServlet.deployFailed\nc- if i manually delete [app].xml, the .war is uploaded, the context.xml is not\nextracted (like if Tomcat thinks it still exists), the deploy task issue the\nsame error as before and the application still doesn't show up in list output.\nd- the same happen if i delete both conf/Catalina/localhost/[app].xml and .war\nfrom webapps\ne- if i stop Tomcat i get the following error, and it won't stop unless i kill it:\n\n INFO main org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11Protocol - Pausing Coyote HTTP/1.1 on\nhttp-8080\n INFO main org.apache.catalina.core.StandardService - Stopping service Catalina\n java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException\n        at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\n        at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.\njava:39)\n        at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAcces\nsorImpl.java:25)\n        at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:585)\n        at org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap.start(Bootstrap.java:271)\n        at org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap.main(Bootstrap.java:409)\nCaused by: java.lang.NullPointerException\n        at org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.removeChild(ContainerBase.java\n:883)\n        at org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig.undeployApps(HostConfig.java:1\n145)\n        at org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig.stop(HostConfig.java:1117)\n        at org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig.lifecycleEvent(HostConfig.java\n:312)\n        at org.apache.catalina.util.LifecycleSupport.fireLifecycleEvent(Lifecycl\neSupport.java:119)\n        at org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.stop(ContainerBase.java:1051)\n        at org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.stop(ContainerBase.java:1063)\n        at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardEngine.stop(StandardEngine.java:442)\n\n        at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardService.stop(StandardService.java:51\n2)\n        at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardServer.stop(StandardServer.java:2044\n)\n        at org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina.stop(Catalina.java:586)\n        at org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina.start(Catalina.java:561)\n        ... 6 more\n\nSorry if i've been too much verbose, but i tried to give you as much details as\ni could, to help you understand the problem.",
