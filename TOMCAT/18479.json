            "body": "I believe the fix for this issue has caused another one.  The Tomcat-5.0.21\nchanglog says the following about the fix for this bug report...\n\n18479: Non-serializable sessions attributes should be removed (so valueUnbound\nis called) (markt)\n\nI have a session that is perfectly serializable in both 5.0.19 and 5.0.20, but\nas of 5.0.21, the value for the session attribute comes back null.  I also\ntested in 5.0.22 with the same result.  The test consists of a hit counter that\nstays in the session and should pick up right where it left off upon\nserver/application reload as long as the session hasn't yet timed out.\n\nI have a HttpSessionAttributeListener reporting when objects are\nadded/removed/replaced in the session.  I get the report of the object in\nquestion being added, but I never see that it has been removed or replaced.  As\nsuch, I must assume that the session attribute is still there, but its value\nchanged to null somewhere behind the scenes in a way that doesn't report it to\nthe HttpSessionAttributeListener (at a minimum, attributeReplaced() should be\ncalled, no?).\n\nIf this report should be separate from this bug, please say so and I'll do that,\nbut this one seems suspect as the cause for the issue I am seeing.  Also let me\nknow if more information is needed or if a test case is needed.  I, obviously,\nhave a test case, but it not exactly simplified.  I'll do that if what I am\nreporting seems non-obvious to the Tomcat gurus.\n\nJake",

Serialization is pretty straight\nforward; either it is serializable and you get no errors or it isn't\nserializable and you get errors.  I get no errors.  How is that not the\ndefinition of \"perfectly serializable\"?  And if removeAttribute() is being\ncalled, why isn't the attributeRemoved() method in my SessionBindingListener\nbeing triggered?  I have println() statements in all methods of my\nSessionBindingListener and the only ones I'm seeing are on attributeAdded(). \nYou can go ahead and stick to your guns and say that my object is not\nserializable (I'm 99.9999% sure it is), but you can't, at the same time, claim\nthat it is being removed from the session when attributeRemoved() is not being\ntriggered.... unless there is a bug where the removeAttribute(keys[i]) call is\nnot notifying listeners of the attributes it is removing.\n\nSo, I guess I'll have to investigate some more, but something is wrong here. \nHopefully we can work together to figure it out.\n\nJake",

            "body": "You were right, Remy,\n\nAfter some investigation, I figured out that one of the packages I was using\nadded a session attribute whose job was to react to cases where it had its\nvalueUnbound() method called and do some cleanup.  However, it was set as an\nanonymous HttpSessionBindingListener which (obviously) doesn't implement\nSerializable.  Besides that, the class in which the anonymous class was created\nis not serializable and if you do a toString() on the session value that was\ncreated, you get the name of the containing class, so I think the containing\nclass would have to be serializable here as well.  In any case, the alternative\nmethod would be to just use a SessionListener#sessionDestroyed() method to do\nthe cleanup.  I think the former method was used because the session is already\ndestroyed in Jetty by the time sessionDestroyed() is called (I think that's\nright?) making cleanup in sessionDestroyed() impossible (That's got to be bad\nbehavior on Jetty's part, but this needs to work with all containers, hence the\nworkaround).  Everything worked under Tomcat after I moved to using\nsessionDestroyed() to do the cleanup.\n\nHowever, shouldn't valueUnbound() be called on the non-serializable attribute\nvalue when it is removed from the session HashTable?  Actually, isn't that\nexactly what this bug is about?  If so, isn't this bug not really fixed?  At the\nvery least, some logging should be done to tell me what happening.  I wouldn't\nhave even have started asking questions here if Tomcat had provided me with some\nhint of what it was doing instead of silently removing non-serializable attributes.\n\n\nJake",
