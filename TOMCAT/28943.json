But in the first window, I see these lines:\n\n----------------\nD:\\programs\\jakarta-tomcat-5.0.24\\bin>startup\nThe system cannot find the path specified.\nUsing CATALINA_BASE:   D:\\programs\\jakarta-tomcat-5.0.24\nUsing CATALINA_HOME:   D:\\programs\\jakarta-tomcat-5.0.24\nUsing CATALINA_TMPDIR: D:\\programs\\jakarta-tomcat-5.0.24\\temp\nUsing JAVA_HOME:       D:\\programs\\j2sdk1.4.2\nD:\\programs\\jakarta-tomcat-5.0.24\\bin>\n-----------------\n\nAnd I found the error is because the below command in in startup.bat(16):\ncd CURRENT_DIR\n\nI also see there is another \"cd CURRENT_DIR\" in catalina.bat(46). I guess this \nis also wrong.",
