However,\nboth the reader of the CGI output and the writer of the servlet output always\napply the platform's default character encoding, since InputStreamReader and\nOutputStreamWriter are constructed without charset.\n\nI've already written the patch. Please contact me by email, then I can send you\nthe revised CGIServlet (the source came from 5.5.15).",
