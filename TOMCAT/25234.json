    "description": "HttpSessionListener called twice on session expiration.\n\nAfter a (quick!) look at the source it seems to be being caused as \nprocessExpires (StandardManager.java) loops through the sessions calling \nisValid (StandardSession.java) on each.  Then isValid itself looks for timed \nout sessions and calls expires (StandardSession.java) where relevant which \ncalls the listeners.  However then isValid returns (false) back to \nprocessExpires which then itself calls expire and so the listeners are fired a \nsecond time.",
