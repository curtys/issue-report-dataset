Since this information is actually used to create and initialize\nthe context, the web application needs to be fully redeployed (which is not done\nat the moment) for the information in META-INF/context.xml to be reread.\n\nI will see if it is possible to do. Otherwise, it will be a WONTFIX.",

From your comment I\ndecided to play around a bit more...\n\ntest #1:\n1) start up tomcat with nothing for /test (dir, context, etc...).\n2) drop /test into webapp dir. Gets deployed with default context.\n3) drop test.xml into conf/.../. Still uses default context.\n4) reload /test from manager. Still uses default context.\nIt should redeploy using test.xml when I drop it into conf/.../\n\nThe opposite is correct(?) If a deployed webapp (/test using conf/.../test.xml)\nhas conf/.../test.xml removed, then the webapp is redeployed using the default\ncontext.\n\ntest #2:\nI have deployed: /test using conf/.../test.xml. If I remove /test dir then\ntest.xml is removed too. Is that planned behaviour...a complete undeploy?\n\ntest #3:\nI have deployed: test.war with expanded /test dir using conf/.../test.xml. If I\nremove /test dir then test.xml is removed too. Then /test dir is recreated from\ntest.war using the default context. Is that planned behaviour...an undeploy\nfollowed by complete new deploy? Changing context values redeploy with nothing\ngetting deleted (as noted above).\n\ntest #4:\nI have deployed: test.war with expanded /test dir using conf/.../test.xml. I\nchange test.xml to unpackWAR=\"false\", and it's still accessing files from /test\nand not test.war. If I delete /test dir I get test #3 obviously. Changing\ncontext values redeploy with nothing getting deleted (just still uses expanded\ndir). Is that planned behaviour?\n\ntest #5:\nI have deployed: test.war using conf/.../test.xml with unpackWAR=\"false\". What\nhappens if I delete test.war? I have a Windoze box that doesn't allow me to\ndelete the war, so I can't test this but I'm assuming that test.xml is deleted\ntoo. right? Changing context values redeploy with nothing getting deleted.\n",
