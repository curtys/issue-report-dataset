This patch improve following problem:\n\n   + The left frame wasn't internationalized.\n   + Some of the word in right frame weren't internationalized.\n   + Some one miss understand\n       MessageResource.getString(java.lang.Locale locale, java.lang.String\n\t\t                 key ..)\n     API. ex. resources.getString(\"mssage\", locale);\n\nI modified English and Japanese ApplicationResources property\nfiles. However I don't know how can I tranlate for Esperanto. So I\nadded TODO comment in ApplicationResources_es.properties.\n\n\nPlease take following patch.\n\n  http://yamaguch.sytes.net/~tora/tmp/tomcat5-admin-i18n.patch\n\nand \n\n + add ApplicationResources.properties\n\n  http://yamaguch.sytes.net/~tora/tmp/ApplicationResources.properties\n\n  * this file is delived from ApplicationResources_en.properties.\n\n + remove ApplicationResources_en.properties.\n\nOne more ask here. SetCharacterEncodingFilter is commented. This means\nother than English people must modify web.xml for input thier own\ncharacter. I would like to uncommend SetCharacterEncodingFilter and\nset default encoding to utf-8. utf-8 is upper compatible with\niso-8859-1 and most of people won't be affected by utf-8. I would like\nto recommend it to conviniency for non English user.\n\nregards,\n\nTakashi Okamoto",
