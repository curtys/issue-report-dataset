Note that when choosing to run Tomcat at the end\nof installation, the tray icon will be used even if Tomcat was installed as a\nservice.\n\nMy own experience with 5.5.17 on Windows 2000 is that it's wrong, the tray icon\nis present when running Tomcat as a service.\n\nSo, I suppose this feature has changed and the doc should be updated.\nOr did I miss something?\n\nThanks",
