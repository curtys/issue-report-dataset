    "description": "Sometime during the Tomcat 5 development, the StandardClassLoader in\norg.apache.catalina.loader package was stripped down, and is now just a\nURLClassLoader.\n\nI work with code that extends the StandardClassLoader (we use the automatic\nreloading of jar files), and during an upgrade from tomcat 4 to tomcat 5.5 found\ndifficultly trying to figure out what had happened to the code.  I ended up\nhaving to install SVN and do a svn log to figure out why the code was removed.\n\nWhen the code was stripped down, the comments in the java file (and therefore in\nthe javadoc api) remained identical, so the javadoc api for the class is very\nmisleading.  For instance, the comments say that the class implements Reloader,\nwhen it in fact does not.\n\nThe class comments should be updated to reflect the state of the code.\n\nI can't see this as being very high priority, but it would likely be an easy to\nfix for people whom are in the code regularly, and it would make the javadoc\nmuch more readable for people that extend the StandardClassLoader for their own\npurposes.",
