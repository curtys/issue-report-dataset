    "description": "Hi,\n\nI'm migrating from Tomcat 5.5.0 to the last version offered in\nhttp://tomcat.apache.org, 5.5.23. When I try to create new contexts via Admin\nTool (/admin), I got a \"successful\" page, but then checking the Catalina logs I\nget errors like the following:\n\norg.apache.catalina.storeconfig.StandardContextSF storeWithBackup\nGRAVE: Cannot move orignal context output file at\n<tomcat_install_dir>/conf/Catalina/localhost/<new_context_name>.xml\n\nAnd no file is written in the folder as expected. Certainly the file doesn't\nexists, because is a new context and that's the name of the file that must be\ncreated. \n\nI've tried this in Linux (SuSE Linux 9.2 Professional, Ubuntu 7.04) and Windows\nXP and with versions 5.5.20 and 5.5.18 with no luck.\n\nI've searched in Google and get the reference to bug 37781, \"Permission error\ncauses malformed server.xml to be saved.\". The fix was the following code:\n\nFile: StandardContextSF.java\n\n    protected void storeWithBackup(StandardContext aContext) throws Exception {\n        StoreFileMover mover = getConfigFileWriter((Context) aContext);\n        if (mover != null) {\n            // Bugzilla 37781 Check to make sure we can write this output file\n            if ((mover.getConfigOld() == null)\n                    || (!mover.getConfigOld().isFile())\n                    || (!mover.getConfigOld().canWrite())) {\n                log.error(\"Cannot move orignal context output file at \"\n                        + mover.getConfigOld());\n                throw new IOException(\"Context orginal file at \"\n                        + mover.getConfigOld()\n                        + \" is null, not a file or not writable.\");\n            }\n\nWhich suggest that if the \"old config file\" doesn't exist (like in this case),\nthe whole operation is aborted. If I create the file just before clicking in the\nbutton \"commit changes\" in the admin page, the file writes successfully and I\nget the context created as expected. \n\nIn our case we tried to go back to version 5.5.16 (which is the version prior to\nthe fix) and in that version this operation works just fine. \n\nCan you check this behavior?
