However, the bug is valid, since \nTomcat doesn't WARN for the case of:\n  <url-pattern>/foo\n               /bar\n  </url-pattern>\n\nThis is fixed now in the CVS and will appear in 5.5.12.",

    "description": "Tomcat does not give error message when a URL in deployment desciptor\ncontains CR, LF. The Servlet 2.4 specs, SRV.13.2 states :\n   \"\u2022 URI paths specified in the deployment descriptor are assumed to be in\nURLdecoded form. The containers must inform the developer with a descriptive\nerror message when URL contains CR(#xD) or LF(#xA). The containers must\npreserve all other characters including whitespace in URL.\" \n     Tomcat allows the application to continue, Which I guess the spec does not\ndictate (?). See the jsp-examples packaged with Tomcat. The web.xml contains the\nfollowing :\n<servlet-mapping>\n        <servlet-name>\n            CompressionFilterTestServlet\n        </servlet-name>\n        <url-pattern>\n            /CompressionTest\n        </url-pattern>\n</servlet-mapping>",
