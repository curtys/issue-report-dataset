For people running this the first time the checkout target will fail\nbecause they need to login to CVS. It would be nice if the following task was\nadded near the top of the checkout target to inform the developer of what needs\nto be done.\n\n<echo level=\"info\"\n     message=\"If the checkouts fail, run `cvs -d ${cvsroot} login` and try again.\"/>",
