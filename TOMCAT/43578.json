            "body": "I encountered a similar problem this morning, with CATALINA_BASE containing a space.\n\nHere's what I have found:\n\n1. The problem seems to be in the setting of JAVA_OPTS in the following:\n# Set juli LogManager if it is present\nif [ -r \"$CATALINA_HOME\"/bin/tomcat-juli.jar ]; then\n  JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS \"-Djava.util.logging.manager=org.apache.juli.ClassLoaderLogManager\" \"-\nDjava.util.logging.config.file=\"$CATALINA_BASE/conf/logging.properties\"\nfi\n\nIf CATALINA_BASE has spaces, the shell splits JAVA_OPTS on the spaces when running the Java \ncommand line, causing the NCDFE.\n\n2. I confirmed this by removing tomcat-juli.jar from bin, and tomcat started fine. This changed logging, \nso it wasn't a proper fix.\n\n3. I was able to get things running, including logging, by making the following changes to catalina.sh\n\n# Set juli LogManager if it is present\nif [ -r \"$CATALINA_HOME\"/bin/tomcat-juli.jar ]; then\n  JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Djava.util.logging.manager=org.apache.juli.ClassLoaderLogManager\" \n  LOGGING_CONFIG=\"-Djava.util.logging.config.file=$CATALINA_BASE/conf/logging.properties\"\nfi\n\nand then adding \"$LOGGING_CONFIG\" (note the quotes) to all places where JAVA_OPTS is passed to the \njava command line. For example:\n\n      exec \"$_RUNJDB\" $JAVA_OPTS \"$LOGGING_CONFIG\" $CATALINA_OPTS \\\n\nI'm not sure if this is the best way to fix this, but it works by keeping the spaces inside CATALINA_BASE \nwithin quotes when passing the arguments to the java command line.\n\n4. The problem exists in the latest 5.5 (5.5.25) and 6.0 (6.0.14), but not in 5.0.x.\n\n",
