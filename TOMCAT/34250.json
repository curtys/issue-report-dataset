We've noticed that ther resulting rewrite of Tomcat\nconfig files can lead to running web applications being reloaded - which can be\ndisasterous for some of our critical apps.\n\nI don't think this behaviour is a bug with Tomcat, but it IS a real problem that\nusers aren't warned about the potentially devastating effect of clicking Commit\nChanges before it happens. A simple dialog warning of the consequences (and\nmentioning that user/role admins don't need this button anyway) would be a huge\nimprovement.",
