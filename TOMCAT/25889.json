But to my dismay, it started hammering my\ndatabase so hard that it was \ncrashing periodically.\t Looking at the code for JDBCStore I noticed that it is\nnow running every single \nquery twice even when it succeeds the first time.   I believe the intent was to\ntry to reconnect on a \ndatabase error but the side effect is to create twice as many queries as needed\nwhen the database is up.",
