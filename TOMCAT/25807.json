I uncommented the CGI related lines in conf/web.xml and \nTomcat appears to be attempting to execute my CGI Perl script. However, I keep \nreceiving the following error. Note, I know the path to the file is correct as \nI'm able to view the file using less by pasting the path from the log into the \ncommand line.\n\n2003-12-29 14:24:01 StandardContext[]cgi: runCGI (stderr):Can't open perl \nscript \"\"/opt/jakarta-tomcat-5.0.16/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/cgi/awstats.pl\"\": No \nsuch file or directory\n2003-12-29 14:24:01 StandardContext[]cgi: runCGI: 1 lines received on stderr\n\nAlso, I just noticed that if I copy server/lib/servlets-cgi.jar from my Tomcat \n4 installation to my Tomcat 5 installation it works just fine, so, it appears \nto be a newly introduced bug.",
