These are needed by \nNetBeans for use in testing and debugging JSPs from within the IDE. \n\nIf you're willing to accept them, I'll attach them here.\n\nNote, they must be placed in the CVS library with the binary substitution \nswitch -Kb.   Otherwise, they will have the wrong format on OpenVMS.\n\nWe're willing to keep our eyes on the dev and user groups in case there are \nany problems/questions.\n\n\nThanks,\nMeg Garrison/Isao Yanagimachi\nHewlett-Packard \nOpenVMS Systems Software Group",
