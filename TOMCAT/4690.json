Therefore the \napplication has to change every year (I mean the application calculation engine \nand the jsp page).  Although it change to new year application, but the old \napplication still has to stay alive for users who haven't migrate their data to \nnew year application.  \n\nEvery year I have to deploy a new application and allow old application can \ncross context to talk to new application.  Due to the session problem, the \nwhole things cannot be done unless I change to another application server.\n\nNow is already version 4.1.18, this bug still haven't solve yet.

IF \nthe Spec specifies cross-context behavior that we don't support (it doesn't), \nthen you'd have a legit Tomcat bug.  \n\nIf the Portlet Spec relies on behavior that is unspecified or unclear in the \nServlet Spec, contact the JSR 154 team (jsr-154-comments@jcp.org) to address \nthe issue.  The Servlet Spec, like the Portlet Spec, is very much alive.  I \nwould not be surprised to see clarification on this cross-context stuff in \nv2.5 of the Servlet Spec.  And needless to say, the next major Tomcat version \nwill implement the next Servlet Spec version accurately and fully, just as it \ndoes now.
