    "description": "Hi,\n\nIn the mod_jk documentation:\n   http://tomcat.apache.org/connectors-doc/reference/workers.html\n\nI see correctly the description for the Avdanced Worker Directive \"secret\":\n\n\"You can set a secret keyword on the Tomcat AJP Connector. Then only requests from workers with the same secret keyword will be accepted. Use request.useSecret=\"true\" and request.secret=\"secret key word\" in your Tomcat AJP Connector configuration. \n\nIf you set a secret on a load balancer, all its members will inherit this secret. \n\nThis feature has been added in jk 1.2.12.\"\n\nHowever, I do not see anymore these request. directives explained in the \"Apache Tomcat Configuration Reference\" > \"The AJP Connector\"\n   http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/config/ajp.html\n   http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/config/ajp.html\n\nNote: that the syntax changed from Tomcat 4.1 to Tomcat 5.5 (I do not know about 5.0).\n\norg.apache.ajp.tomcat4.Ajp13Connector was only one attribute\n   secret=\"secret_word\"\n\nIt might be a good idea to add a line for these 2 attributes even if just simply refer to the jk documentation.\n\nThanks - Fred",
