Implement authenticate(X509Certificate certs[]) just like\n   the user/pwd-authenticate in JAASrealm.\n2. Add an appropriate CallbackHandler for the cert chain\n   to pass the certificates to the custom LoginModule.\n\nThe custom authorization stuff has to go to the LoginModule\nso the new JAASRealm2 should be finished.\n\nPlease let me know if you plan to implement it.",

    "description": "I tried to config my webapp to authenticate user by CLIENT-CERT auth method.\n\nI verified my JAAS LoginModule by using \"BASIC\" to auth method and successfully \nauthenticated user login.\n\nAfter studying Tomcat 5.5.20 source, I found that the problem is caused by the \nRealmBase.java and JAASRealm.java.\n\nif CLIENT-CERT auth method is used, SSLAuthenticator will call the :\n\n  JAASRealm.authenticate(X509Certificate certs[])\n\nAs JAASRealm didn't override authenticate(X509Certificate certs[]), RealmBase's \nauthenticate will be used and it will only validate the certs and then call\ngetPrincipal(X509Certificate) and then getPrincipal(String) is being called to \nget the Principal. However, in JAASRealm, this function always return null.\n\nThat means Tomcat can't use JAASRealm with CLIENT-CERT auth method.\n\nThanks\nButler",
