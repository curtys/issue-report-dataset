    "description": "This problem occurs when you have a symbolic link to the tomcat scripts on your\nPATH that links to the tomcat script using a relative path.\n\nSteps to reproduce bug:\n\n1. Go to some directory on your PATH. I'm using ~/bin which I've added to my PATH\n\n2. Create a relative symlink to the tomcat statup script. I did: ln -s\n../download/tmp/apache-tomcat-5.5.15/bin/catalina.sh start-tomcat\n\n3. Run the symlink. It fails with the following message:\n/home/adam/bin/start-tomcat: line 72: cd:\n../download/tmp/apache-tomcat-5.5.15/bin/..: No such file or directory\nCannot find /home/adam/bin/setclasspath.sh\nThis file is needed to run this program\n\n\nThis can be fixed by changing the line:\n\nif expr \"$link\" : '.*/.*' > /dev/null; then\n\nto:\n\nif expr \"$link\" : '/.*' > /dev/null; then\n\nin all the .sh scripts. After changing it in catalina.sh, my relative symlink\nworks correctly. I've tested my fix using a chain of symlinks (both absolute and\nrelative) that finally resolve to catalina.sh and it seems to work fine.\n\nOne of my coworkers pointed out that this same error was in the Maven scripts,\nand that they fixed it recently (looks like the same fix I suggested). I imagine\na lot of open source projects are sharing scripts and code, so if you agree that\nthis is the correct fix someone should check to see if other apache/jakarta\nprojects need their scripts updated.",
