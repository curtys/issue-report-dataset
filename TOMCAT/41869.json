    "description": "I have a custom tag with attributes defined in the TLD file as allowing run-\ntime expression values, meaning:\n\n  <rtexprvalue>true</rtexprvalue>\n\n\nI also have a TagExtraInfo class that I am using to validate the values \nprovided.\n\nInside my TagExtraInfo sub-class I have code such as this:\n\n   Object attr = data.getAttribute(\"groupSize\");\n \n   if ( attr != null &&\n        !attr.equals(TagData.REQUEST_TIME_VALUE)\n   {\n \nand so on.   When, in my JSP, I provide attribute values such as \"<%= 10 * 14 \n%\" (JSP scriplet) I do indeed get the TagData.REQUEST_TIME_VALUE object back \non this call.\n\nHowever, when I instead have an EL value, something like \"${groupSizeValue}\", \nI do not received the REQUEST_TIME_VALUE distinguished object back.  I receive \na String object, containing the text \"${groupSizeValue}\".  Is this the correct \nbehavior?  Everything I have read (books, Google searches, etc.) seems to \npoint me in the thinking that this is a bug.\n\n\nFrom looking at the tomcat 5.5.20 and 5.5.23 source code, I see where the \nJspAttribute (nested class of Node) is created.  In the Validator class, line \n1117, is the creation for this object passing the constant \"false\" for \nthe \"expr\" argument (5th argument to the 1st ctor of this class).  I believe \nit is line 1117 that would be getting executed since the if statement \npreceding this is:\n\n   if (el.containsEL() && !pageInfo.isELIgnored()) {\n \n \nSo, my question is, why would an EL expression when EL is not being ignored be \nconsidered not an expression?",
