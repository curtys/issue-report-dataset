Either that or the\nCocoon developers misunderstood some subtle aspect of the servlet specification,\nbut that doesn't seem likely to me.",

I am using the <security-constraint> in \nmy web.xml.\n\nAt first I could not get the FORM login to work only BASIC. Then I changed the \nFORM action to <%= response.encodeURL(\"j_security_check\") %>, and I was able \nuse FORM login.\n\nThe next problem is that the auth is only accepted for the page that activated \nthe FORM page. For example <url-pattern>/public/*</url-pattern> contains \ntest.jsp and test2.jsp and when I link to test.jsp the FORM page is called. \nWhen succesfully logged in the request.getRemoteUser() is correct. But when I \nthen link from there to test2.jsp the request.getRemoteUser() is NULL and the \nFORM page is called again.\n\nPlease let me know if I sould send more info.",
