Delaying setting\nthem will not change anything, so the specification exact wording WILL NOT be\nimplemented. I am -1 for fixing this, as the container should use special\nhandling for all special HTTP headers, and restrict access to them.\n\nSome part of the bug seems valid, though (although it should be noted that the\nspec is too complex; as usual, why have three ways of doing the same thing ?).",

It also sets the response's \n  character encoding appropriately for the locale, if the character encoding\n  has not been explicitly set using setContentType(String) or \n  setCharacterEncoding(String) , getWriter hasn\u2019t been called yet, and the \n  response hasn\u2019t been committed yet. ...\n\nCoyoteResponse breaks two of these rules:\n1) It doesn't set the Content-Language header (by calling Response.setLocale())\n   if setContentType() or setCharacterEncoding() has been called. It should\n   make this call in all cases, as long as the response has not been committed.\n2) It doesn't set the charset attribute of the Content-Type header (by calling\n   Response.setCharacterEncoding()) if setContentType() has been called. It\n   should make this call even if setContentType() has been called, as long\n   as the specified content type doesn't include a charset attribute.",
