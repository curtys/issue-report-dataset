In the context.xml I have \nreloadable=\"false\" antiJarLocking=\"true\" and antiResourceLocking=\"true\" \nalongiwth the standard docBase and path.  No other entries are present.  If I \nuse the manager interface I can install the application and it works fine.  If \nI then shutdown tomcat gracefully, the application is completely deleted from \nthe file system.  The context from the /conf/Catalina/localhost is not \ndeleted.  On start of tomcat the application is not loaded (since it has been \ndeleted from the file system).  If I use the antiResourceLocking=true in the \nwebapps directory it does not delete the application content only when used \noutside of webapps.  \n\nTo work around this I removed the antiResourceLocking from the context.xml.  \nThis seems to resolve the issue for now.  This may be a good addition to the \ndocs somewhere.",
