    "description": "There seems to be a slight inconsistency on the <distributable/> \nimplementation as it will throw a ISE only if the manager is set to \ndistributable=\"true\". The manager will NOT inherit the webapp distributable \nproperty.\n\nThe documentation looks fairly consistent with my interpretation of the \nServlet 2.4 specification (7.7.2), the Tomcat documentation states about the \nManager distributable property that:\n\n---\nSet to true to ask the session manager to enforce the restrictions described \nin the Servlet Specification on distributable applications (primarily, this \nwould mean that all session attributes must implement java.io.Serializable). \nSet to false (the default) to not enforce these restrictions.\n\nNOTE - The value for this property is inherited automatically based on the \npresence or absence of the <distributable> element in the web application \ndeployment descriptor (/WEB-INF/web.xml).\n---\n\nLooking at the source code, it is clear to me that this is not the case as the \nManager setDistributable property is only set when parsing the server.xml (or \ncontext that is)",
