Other nodes in the cluster receive messages with an\nincorrect manager name, after a distributable context is updated by adding or\nupdating a jar or the web.xml file.\n\nThe name appears to be appended to it's previous value after each reload.\nOther members of the cluster log messages from the updated node as follows:\n\n SEVERE: Context manager doesn't exist:host1host1\n SEVERE: Context manager doesn't exist:host1host1host1\n\n(In our case there was only a root context in each host.)\n\nThe Cluster definition is exactly as it is in the default server.xml, except\nthat it's placed at the Engine level, rather than inside a Host.",
