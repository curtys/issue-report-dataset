The one big ZIP file contains a lot of things, and it's\nhard to evaluate how it would fit int existing Tomcat code as well as possible\nbugs / merge conflicts.\n\nI also suggest you diff against the latest stable release on the branch you\nwant, e.g. 5.5.23 for the 5.5 branch or 6.0.10 for the 6.0 branch.\n\nThanks ;)",
