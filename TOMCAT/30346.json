    "description": "When using the /bin/service.bat on a windows system the service is created, \nbut seems to leave a not 100% functional tomcat. tomcat is starting fine. If \nyou browse a uncompiled jsp, you receive the following message:\n\n..\norg.apache.jasper.JasperException: Unable to compile class for JSP\n..\nUnable to find a javac compiler;\ncom.sun.tools.javac.Main is not on the classpath.\nPerhaps JAVA_HOME does not point to the JDK\n\torg.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.compilers.CompilerAdapterFactory.getCompi\nler(CompilerAdapterFactory.java:106)\n..\n\nThe environment variables are set correct! Running the /bin/startup script \neverything works fine, i.e. jsp's got compiled correct.\n\nAt my web-search i found people who have the same problem, but i couldn't \nfound the bug in the database. Someone tell to use the windows-installer-exe \n(jakarta-tomcat-5.0.27.exe) and define the JAVA_HOME to use. I've done this \nand the guy was right. \n\nThe service that was installed within the installation process of jakarta-\ntomcat-5.0.27.exe works fine. This service compiles jsp's as well, but the \nservice.bat did not!\n\nIt would be great to hear soon from you:)\n\nThanks in advance, Leif",
