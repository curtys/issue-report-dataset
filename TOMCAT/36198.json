    "description": "I have encountered an odd error I have been unable to solve.  I have reviewed \nall the Tomcat documentation and searched Bugzilla for a solution but nothing \nhas worked so far.  In summary I have created a set of JSPs and Java classes \nthat are used to visualize pre-generated biological data for a research \nproject.  These JSPs interact with the Java classes to perform some file IO and \nother activities.  The problem I have encountered is as follows: the JSPs spit \nout java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError errors when accessed, so I've concluded they \ncannot 'see' the Java classes I have created for them to use.  I have gone \nthrough a number of troubleshooting solutions including: Placing the classes in \nthe 'WEB-INF/classes' directory of the web application root where the JSPs are \nstored, copying the classes to the working dorectory where the JSPs are \ncompiled (both en masse and with the full package structure), and I have tried \nspecifying the CLASSPATH used to compile the JSPs with the web.xml file in \nthe 'WEB-INF' directory of the web application root.  None of these have solved \nthe problem.  The exact error I'm getting is as follows: \n\njavax.servlet.ServletException: Replacer\n\torg.apache.jasper.runtime.PageContextImpl.doHandlePageException\n(PageContextImpl.java:848)\n\torg.apache.jasper.runtime.PageContextImpl.handlePageException\n(PageContextImpl.java:781)\n\torg.apache.jsp.mode_005fshape_005fvisual_jsp._jspService\n(org.apache.jsp.mode_005fshape_005fvisual_jsp:235)\n\torg.apache.jasper.runtime.HttpJspBase.service(HttpJspBase.java:97)\n\tjavax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:802)\n\torg.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServletWrapper.service\n(JspServletWrapper.java:322)\n\torg.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet.serviceJspFile(JspServlet.java:291)\n\torg.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet.service(JspServlet.java:241)\n\tjavax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:802)\n\n\nroot cause \n\njava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Replacer\n\tMode_Shape_Session.<init>(Mode_Shape_Session.java:183)\n\torg.apache.jsp.mode_005fshape_005fvisual_jsp._jspService\n(org.apache.jsp.mode_005fshape_005fvisual_jsp:143)\n\torg.apache.jasper.runtime.HttpJspBase.service(HttpJspBase.java:97)\n\tjavax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:802)\n\torg.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServletWrapper.service\n(JspServletWrapper.java:322)\n\torg.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet.serviceJspFile(JspServlet.java:291)\n\torg.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet.service(JspServlet.java:241)\n\tjavax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:802)\n\nTo generate the problem go to the URL listed with this bug report and click on \nthe \"Go iGNM\" button.\n\nHow do I configure Tomcat to look for my Java classes when compiling JSPs?  Or \nwhere do I place the compiled classes so the JSP compiler can see them when the \nJSPs are compiled?  This project will result in a article publication in a \nmajor scientific journal, and any help you can offer would surely be noted in \nsaid article.  \n\nThanks,\n  Mark Holliman",
