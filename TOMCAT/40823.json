    "description": "The documentation (http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-\ndoc/config/context.html) encourages users to define their context's outside of \nthe server.xml file to enable hot-deployments.  The documentation also \nsays \"If you specify a context path of an empty string (\"\"), you are defining \nthe default web application for this Host, which will process all requests not \nassigned to other Contexts\"  Unfortunately, unless the context is defined \ninside the server.xml file, Tomcat doesn't recognize the empty string path \nvalue.  The workaround suggested on the user mailing list was:\nTo specify the default app, you must first delete the existing webapps/ROOT \ndirectory, then install your app in webapps/ROOT (or webapps/ROOT.war) or put \nyour <Context> element in conf/[engine]/[host]/ROOT.xml.\n\nThis bug is to request the documentation be updated to include the \ninstructions for specifying the default context when it's defined physically \noutside of the server.xml file.  \n\nThe dev mailing list indicated this is also how Tomcat 6 works.",
