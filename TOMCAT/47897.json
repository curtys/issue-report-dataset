    "description": "We are using Tomcat 5.5.17 and everytime we try to stop the service from windows server 2003, we get error 1053 (It seems Microsoft uses this code if the service start/stop timeout)\nI have tried to look for the solution to this as our softwares use Apache tomcat 5.5.17. I have even tried editing catalina.bat to have conditional statement to exclude JAVA_OPTS while stopping but it didn't help. This was one of the solution I found when I was searching on google.\nI am sure there is fix for this but I was unable to find it. \nCan someone please let us know?\n\nThanks!",
