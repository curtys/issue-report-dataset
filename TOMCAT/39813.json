    "description": "JMXProxyServlet.java at revision 411724.\n\nUsing MBean qry operation, if an attribute returns a String containing a\nnewline, the character before the newline is removed by the escape method (uses\nidx-1 instead of idx on line 204).\ne.g. PermGenStatus: Perm Gen : 19.93% (26739168/134217728\\n\n\nFurthermore, the end int is not checked to be > 0 in the appendHead method - so\nanything starting with a newline would end up being a substring(0,-1) call (line\n223) - resulting in an StringIndexOutOfBoundsException(\"String index out of\nrange: -1\") which would then drop into \"} catch (Exception e) {} // Ignore\" in\nlistBeans causing any further attributes to not be printed out. \n\nFinally, the get operation does not use the escape method in getAttribute (line\n114) so will print newlines. Guess this contravenes the JMX spec 1.2 - whose\nchanges log says \"...the newline character ('\\n') is forbidden everywhere. This\nrule is new with 1.2.\"",
