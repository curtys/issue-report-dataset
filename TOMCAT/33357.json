The one decribed in this\nreport is however far more severe. ",

    "description": "o.a.c.r.DataSourceRealm leaks connections (does not return to the pool) in\ngetRoles(String). The new connection is obtained from the data source, but never\nreturned. Bedides there seems to be a slight performance optimization possible\nso that the getRoles makes use of the very same connection the authenticate()\ndoes. Right now the whole authentication process i.e. authentication and\nretrieval of user roles (which I consider as a whole and non-separable) requires\n*two* connections of which one is never returned. I observe the increase of the\nnumber of database backend. It eventually reaches the limit rendering the Realm\nunusable.\n\nOne might workaround it by adding the following attributes in her datasource\nResource definition: removeAbandoned=\"true\" removeAbandonedTimeout=\"15\".
