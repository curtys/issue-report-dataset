    "description": "Hi there !\n\nMy name is Rost Vashevnik and I am Tyrex project admin. It has been brought to \nmy attention that links from Tomcat's documentation to Tyrex site are broken (I \nbelieve this is the case for all versions of Tomcat). Tyrex has moved from \nhttp://tyrex.exolab.org to http://tyrex.sourceforge.net some time ago. More \nimportantly (and embarassingly for us all) http://tyrex.exolab.org does not \nrespond properly any more. So your (and potentially our) user is at a loss what \nto do. \n\nI hope you coud fix it quikly to our common benefit.\n\nAlso we have just released another version of Tyrex, which uses latest third \nparty libraries. Please let me know if you would like me to review \nTomcat's \"How to counfigure Tyrex\" documentation and submit updated \ninstructions. \n\nThank you for your time\n\nKind regards\n\nRost Vashevnik",
