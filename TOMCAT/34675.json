When\nTomcat is running standalone with the Coyote HTTP/1.1 Connector, it will\ngenerally report the server name specified in the request, and the port number\non which the Connector is listening. The two servlet API calls of interest, for\nthis purpose, are:\n\n    * ServletRequest.getServerName()\n    * ServletRequest.getServerPort()\n\n\n\n\"and the port number on which the Connector is listening\" - NOT TRUE.\nWhen proxyPort is not specified, getServerPort() gives the port number which is\non the client side request - not the real one on which the Connector is listening.\nPlease correct doc.",
