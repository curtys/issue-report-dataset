    "description": "Tomcat can't compile certain tag files:\n\n1) Tag files whose relative pathname contains a component (one of the \ndirectories, or the filename without the \".tag\" suffix) which is not a legal \nJava identifier.  Tomcat converts the relative pathname to a fully-qualified \nclass name, and if the parts aren't all legal Java identifiers, the Java \ncompiler will throw an error.\n\n2) Tag files in /<some_directories>/<immediate_parent_directory>/ when there's \na tag file in /<some_directories>/ with \nfilename \"<immediate_parent_directory>.tag\".  Here the problem is that the \npackage of the tag files in /<some_directories>/<immediate_parent_directory>/ \nclashes with the class of the \"<immediate_parent_directory>.tag\" tag file.  \nFor instance, the tag file /WEB-INF/tags/foo/bar.tag will have package name \norg.apache.jsp.tag.web.foo, which conflicts with the fully-qualified class \nname of the tag file /WEB-INF/tags/foo.tag.\n\nI will attach a patch that fixes this.",
