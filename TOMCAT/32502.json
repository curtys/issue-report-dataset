    "description": "The DigestAuthenticator class contains a small but significant leak. In the generateNOnce method, the \nnOnceValue is inserted into a Hashtable with an expire time. This feature does not appear to be fully \nimplemented and as a result the Hashtable \"nOnceTokens\" will continue to grow un-bounded.\n\nThe short term solution to this problem is to remove the Hashtable insert since it isn't apparently being \nused.\n\nLonger term, the host-expireTime-otherState tuple could be encoded in client-opaque nOnceValue and \nused across multiple TC5 instances.",
