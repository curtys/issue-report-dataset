    "description": "In TC 7, 6, 5.5 build scripts in several places we use <jar index=\"true\"/>, which creates META-INF/INDEX.LIST file in the JAR.\n\nI should say that\na) The JAR Index feature is designed to speed up location and download of other *.jar files. It is not intended to be used on a single file.\n\nSee specification [1], blog article that describes main problems [2], ANT documentation on JAR task and especially the nested \"indexjars\" element as described there [3].\n\nOne should use <indexjars> element inside the <jar> task to exploit this feature properly.\n\n\nb) It does not speed up processing of a single JAR.\n\nFirst, a JAR file already has an index, \"Central Directory\" - see picture in Wikipedia article [4], or official specification from PKWARE [5].\n\nAFAIK, in Sun JRE this central directory is always read and loaded into memory before any random-access query on the file is performed, such as ZipFile#getEntry(String).\n\nSecond, an URLClassLoader has to consider JARs mentioned in the Index file. It incurs some overhead, though I have not measured how much it is.\n\n\nc) Using Index file can conflict with \"Class-Path\" entry of the manifest. See [2] for explanation.\n\nAlso the text of the index file starts with the name of the current JAR file. I suppose that it can have some consequences if the file is renamed.\n\n\nBased on the above, we have to use index=\"false\" on all our <jar> tasks.\n\n\nLinks:\n[1] JAR Index specification - JDK 1.5\nhttp://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/jar/jar.html#JAR%20Index\n\n[2] To Use or not to Use Jar Index - A blog article\nhttp://javahowto.blogspot.com/2006/08/to-use-or-not-to-use-jar-index.html\n\n[3] Jar Task - Apache ANT Documentation\nhttp://ant.apache.org/manual/CoreTasks/jar.html\n\n[4] ZIP (file format) - Wikipedia\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_%28file_format%29#Technical_information\n\n[5] ZIP APPNOTE - PKWARE\nhttp://www.pkware.com/support/zip-application-note",
