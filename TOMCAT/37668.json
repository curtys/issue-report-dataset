Reading around I found that using antiResourceLocking causes tomcat\nto copy the webapp to a temp folder. My guess is that the jsp file I am editing\nin the webapps/app directory is no longer the one that tomcat is using, and\nhence I see no changes. Probably should say this in the Context Reference\ndocumentation.",
