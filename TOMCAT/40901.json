I'm attaching a simple patch that incorporates\nbasic HTML encoding into o.a.catalina.servlets.DefaultServlet when outputting a\ndirectory index (whether as HTML or XML).  The method in question is basically\nthe same as used in o.a.catalina.util.DOMWriter and in HTMLFilter.java in the\nJSR152/154 examples.",
