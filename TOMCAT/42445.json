    "description": "Hi,\n\nOur application is deployed on Gentoo Linux which installs tomcat from source\nvia the portage tool. We were concerned portage wasn't building tomcat correctly\nwhen we saw that the minor version of tomcat (example 5.5.23) wasn't being\ndisplayed when using the ServerInfo() method, or running the version.sh script.\n\nAfter building tomcat from source on Windows, we see the same issue:\n\ntomcat built from source is not showing the full version number in the\nServerInfo.properties file located in catalina.jar (/org/apache/catalina/util/)\n\nexample #1\n\nbuilt from: jakarta-tomcat-5.5.9-src.zip\nServerInfo.properties shows: \n\nserver.info=Apache Tomcat/5.5\nserver.number=5.5.0.0\nserver.built=May 17 2007 05:04:58\n\nusing pre-compiled binary: jakarta-tomcat-5.5.9.zip\nServerInfo.properties shows:\n\nserver.info=Apache Tomcat/5.5.9\nserver.number=5.5.9.0\nserver.built=Mar 26 2005 02:21:04\n\n\nexample #2\n\nbuilt from: apache-tomcat-5.5.20-src.zip\nServerInfo.properties shows:\nserver.info=Apache Tomcat/5.5\nserver.number=5.5.20.0\nserver.built=May 17 2007 04:01:36\n\nusing pre-compiled binary: apache-tomcat-5.5.20.zip\nServerInfo.properties shows:\n\nserver.info=Apache Tomcat/5.5.20\nserver.number=5.5.20.0\nserver.built=Sep 12 2006 10:09:20\n\n\nexample #3\n\nbuilt from: apache-tomcat-5.5.23-src.zip\nServerInfo.properties shows: \nserver.info=Apache Tomcat/5.5\nserver.number=5.5.20.0\nserver.built=May 17 2007 03:55:46\n\nusing pre-compiled binary: apache-tomcat-5.5.23.zip\nServerInfo.properties shows:\n\nserver.info=Apache Tomcat/5.5.23\nserver.number=5.5.23.0\nserver.built=Mar 5 2007 08:25:04\n\n\nAre there plans to make the information displayed in ServerInfo.properties\nconsistent between the source and binary distributions (without having to\nmanually edit this file)?\n\nAre there good reasons for obscuring the version displayed?\n\n\nThanks.\n\nKei",
