    "description": "I'm using JNDIRealm to authenticate to OpenLDAP 2.2.28.  Within OpenLDAP I've\nconfigured the userPassword attribute for each user to contain the MD5 digest,\nand each is prefixed with the string \"{MD5}\".  I am not an LDAP expert by any\nmeans but I believe this prefix is a standard convention.  Anyway assuming this\nis a convention then JNDIRealm needs to strip off the \"{MD5}\" portion much like\nit does with \"{SHA1}\".  See attached patch which accomplishes this and I\nverified it works in my environment.",
