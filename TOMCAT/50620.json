In org.apache.catalina.connector.Request.recycle() method, if an exception is thrown by session.endAccess() call, request object recycling aborts failing to cleanup fully and leaving the request object in inconsistent state. Further requests processed by CoyoteAdapter.service() using this inconsistent request object result in request being redirected to the last url that resulted in inconsistent request object which is still holding on to wrong session and contexts.",
