This process does not take\naccount of the effect of antiResourceLocking (which is turned on in the\nMETA-INF\\context.xml file). If a webapp with this option turned on is running\nwhen the Commit Changes button is pressed, the antiResourceLocking-modified\ndocBase will be written out to disk.\n\nThe problem is that should you then stop Tomcat (with the webapp still running),\non startup it will read in the docBase and get very confused because it can't\nfind the webapp in the \\temp\\ folder (which of course got deleted on shutdown\ncos it was only temporary). Net result is you can't access the webapp and have\nto undeploy and redeploy.",
