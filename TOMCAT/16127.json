I agree, but\nJSP.4.2 actually does not mention anything about it. I'll ping Mark to see if he\ncould clarify JSP.4.2.\n\nThanks,\n\nJan\n\n",

    "description": "According to JSP.4.1 of the 2.0 specificiation, Files included using the include\ndirective are read using the character encoding of the including page.\n\nFor my case, I have a JSP Document encoded in UTF-16BE (the JSP Document also\nsets the response content type to text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1\".  The document\nuses an include directive to include another text document also encoded in\nUTF-16BE.  \n\nReviewing the result of the page, I can see that the included content is still\nin UTF-16BE instead of ISO-8859-1 (note, I can leave off the contentType\nattribute of the page directive so that the response is text/xml with a charset\nof UTF-8, but it makes no difference).\n\nHere is the calling JSP Document:\n-------------------------------------------------\n?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-16BE\"?>\n<root xmlns:jsp=\"http://java.sun.com/JSP/Page\">\n    <jsp:directive.page contentType=\"text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1\" />\n    <jsp:directive.include file=\"inclusion_utf-16BE.txt\" />\n</root>\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nThe included text file contains (encoded in UTF-16BE):       \n    <included>Included Content</included>\n\n\nThe result that I'm seeing looks something like:\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\n<root\nxmlns:jsp=\"http://java.sun.com/JSP/Page\">^@<^@i^@n^@c^@l^@u^@d^@e^@d^@>^@I^@n^@c^@l^@u^@d^@e^@d^@\n^@C^@o^@n^@t^@e^@n^@t^@<^@/^@i^@n^@c^@l^@u^@d^@e^@d^@>^@\n</root>\n\nThis was working in previous builds.",
