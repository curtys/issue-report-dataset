    "description": "Exactly similar to bug 34654, I have an identical ZipException when using the\ntag attribute while deploying remotely using the ant <deploy> task. In bug\n34654, comment 2, Yoav had mentioned something to the effect that he couldn't\nreproduce it and neither could the OP. I don't think the OP in bug 34654 ever\nmentioned that he couldn't reproduce it. I don't know why the OP never disputed\nthat assumption.\n\nI can easily reproduce it by having a <deploy> ant task with a tag attribute\nsuch as:\n\n<deploy url=\"http://${host}:8080/manager\"\n        username=\"${tomcat.username}\"\n        password=\"${tomcat.password}\"\n        path=\"/${app.name}\"\n        update=\"true\"\n        tag=\"${tag.war}\"\n        war=\"file:${gen.dir}/war/${webapp.war}\"/>\n\nIf I take out the tag attribute, the remote deploy works fine.\n\nThis is with tomcat 5.5.9, sun-jdk-1.5.0.03 on a Gentoo Linux machine.\n\nWhat the OP of bug 34654 was referring to in bug 34654, comment 1 was the fact\nthat if you look inside the remote hosts' work/Catalina/localhost/manager\ndirectory, you will find a fully intact war file with the properly named\ndirectory (as per the tag). And indeed, the war file in that directory is\ncomplete and does not have any defects and/or corruptions.",
