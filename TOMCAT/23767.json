I\nhave already raised this issue on the tomcat-user list:\n\nhttp://www.mail-archive.com/tomcat-user@jakarta.apache.org/msg106090.html\n\nand was therefore fairly certain that this is an issue. Please would you provide\nsome more indication as to why this is not an issue, or otherwise re-open this. \n\nFurther explanation will ultimately be of benefit to you as well, since others\nfacing the same situation as myself may well then read it here and learn from\nit, rather than opening another bug or generating more traffic on the lists.\n\nThanks\nAdam",
