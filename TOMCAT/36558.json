This cache has hard \nreferences, so when used against an application class (often an exception), the \nclassloader of that application will never be unloaded.\n\nNotice that changing the cache to a WeakHashMap would not help, as the class \nreference is also inside the Method object stored in the value field.\n\nI think the same class (IntrospectionUtils) exists in the commons-modeler \nlibrary, with the same problem.",
