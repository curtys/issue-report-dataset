    "description": "The documentation page at http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-\ndoc/config/valve.html says:\n\n\"The syntax for regular expressions is different than that for 'standard' \nwildcard matching. Tomcat uses the Jakarta Regexp library. Please consult the \nRegexp documentation for details of the expressions supported.\"\n\nThis is incorrect. In reality, the standard Java regexp package java.util.regex \nis used. The syntax is slightly different than Jakarta Regexp. In particular, \nthe matches() method is used by RemoteAddrValve/RemoteHostValve, which attempts \nto match the entire region against the pattern. \n\nE.g. I expected\n<Valve allow=\"^127\\.\" ...\nto match localhost addresses. But this doesn't work, I must write \n<Valve allow=\"127\\.0\\.0\\.\\d\" ...\nbecause the *entire* region is matched with java.util.regex. (Note the lack of \nanchor.)\n\n(While I'm reporting this as a documentation issue, it could also be viewed as \na feature regression since region matches were previously supported, as far as \nI can tell.)\n\nNOTE: I'm logging this problem against 5.5, but it also exists in the 6.0 \ndocumentation.",
