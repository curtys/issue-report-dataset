The tomcat native support does not respect this flag, and tries to call the sendfile routine anyway, \nresulting in a crash at runtime.\n\nThis occurs, for instance, on Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger, where the underlying sendfile routine is not \nimplemented.\n\nPerhaps there's a way to back away from using sendfile if the routine doesn't exist, while still allowing the \nrest of apr support?",
