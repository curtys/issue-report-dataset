When I ran it, it needed classes for JspC.  Oh wait, I\nmay have run it against 5.0.28 however.  That would be awsome if that's all it\nneeded! :)\n\nif that's the case in the nightly then we should be able to get away with:\n\n<project name=\"Catalina Ant Tasks\">\n  <!-- set catalina.home if it's not already set -->\n  <dirname property=\"catalina.home.bin.dir\" file=\"${ant.file.imported}\"/>\n  <property name=\"catalina.home\" value=\"${catalina.home.bin.dir}/..\"/>\n  <taskdef resource=\"org/apache/catalina/ant/catalina.tasks\"\n           classpath=${catalina.home}/server/lib/catalina-ant.jar\"/>\n</project>\n\nEven if not, we can cause it to have a faster load by isolating the jars that it\nreally needs (catalina-ant.jar plus the ones for JspC).  I'll have to\nexperiement with this more after I have slept.\n\nThanks!\nDaniel\n",

    "description": "Using ant tasks to deploy, undeploy apps, etc. requires one to copy and paste\ntaskdefs from the documentation into their build.xml which is messy.  The docs\nalso instruct the user to copy the catalina-ant.jar file into the $ANT_HOME/lib\ndirectory, which is unnecessary if you specify the classpath in your taskdef\nelement and should be avoided when possible.\n\nI propose that we have a centralized ant project file will solve these problems\nfor the with a single line of code.  Then update the manager-how-to doc to\nspecify how to import this .xml file which is much cleaner.  With this solution,\nthe user would need the following code in their ant build script to use the\ntasks.  I assume here that they have set the catalina.home property elsewhere\n(hopefully their build.properties file):\n\n<import file=\"${catalina.home}/bin/catalina-tasks.xml\"/>\n\nAnother possible solution to this problem is to use taskdef and specify the\nresource catalina.tasks (under org.apache.catalina.ant) and then specify the\nclasspath inline.  However, this also includes the JspC task which has a good\ndeal of dependencies and requires you to import a lot of jar files to run.\n\nI believe that this solution represents a good balance of consideration for\nthese issues.  The new \"catalina-tasks.xml\" file will live in $CATALINA_HOME/bin\nwhich will import everything in catalina.tasks, including JspC and also import\nthe needed jar files.  It will also self-discover the correct catalina.home if\nit was not previously specified.\n\nDrawbacks to this approach:  This will slow the build more than excluding JspC\nbecause the JspC taskdef will load more classes than just the pure Catalina tasks.\n\nBonuses of this approach:  This makes JspC available as well and also prevents\nthe need for either:\na.) another catalina.tasks file that does not contains JspC (e.g.,\n\"pure-catalina.tasks\")\nb.) the removal of JspC from catalina.tasks (I don't know the dependencies here)\nor\nc.) putting a taskdef line in the catalina-imports.xml file for each task that\nwe want to import instead of using a bulk include like I am proposing now.",
