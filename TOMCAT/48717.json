The HttpSessionListener methods work fine on each node.\n\nThe application adds an attribute to a session which implements HttpSessionActivationListener, HttpSessionBindingListener and Serializable.  The HttpSessionBindingListener methods work fine on each node.\n\nWhen restarting a node, the session attribute never receives any calls to sessionDidActivate when that node comes back online.\n\nLet me know if you need any more details.",
