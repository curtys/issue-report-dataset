View the available memory.  You will see it\ncycle within a meg as garbage collection is run.  Then use Tomcat Manager to\nreload the struts webapp.  The free memory should now be a meg less.  This will\ncontinue until you reach 0, when a major garbage collection will occur, but it\njust looks like memory is released, as the Total Memory usage has now increased.\n You can continue this cycle until the memory reaches the total allocated, and\nTomcat will fall over.\n\nIf this is truly a \"non issue\", then I feel the Tomcat developers need to answer\nthis issue more directly (like the release notes).\n\nWe have customers that run multiple occurrences of our webapp under a single\nTomcat, and need to reload... With the leak... they end up having to restart\nTomcat to free the memory... causing support issues.\n\nI look forward to become more educated on why this is (not) an issue...",

While the classloader is not being garbage collected\n(this is the only object not being GCed) due to an unknown reason, no references\nare kept to it (as seen in a profiler), so from the Tomcat programming\nperspective, there's nothing to fix. Many \"simple\" webapps reload without\nleaking memory, but Struts webapps seem to pose a problem. Of course, there are\nalso ways for a shared library to cause GC trouble when reloading, and this\ncannot be fixed, so you cannot assume a webapp reload will never leak memory.\n\nThere's nothing in the release notes, because there's no conclusive information\navailable.",

If this is something that the Tomcat team will not\naddress, it should be noted in the release notes, or in the Manager App HOW-TO.\n Our organization made number of decisions based on the functionality of the\nManager app that were thrown out once we observed this memory leak.  Although\nthere may be no conclusive evidence showing this is a problem in Tomcat, a\nnumber of people have consistently observed this behavior in the Manager\napplication, and would agree that it is not desired behavior.  To save other\norganizations from going through the problems we did, a simple blurb about this\nknown behavior would be more that appreciated.\n\nThanks,\nJames Norman",

            "body": "After seaching the net I found that there indeed exists a problem with Struts \nthat prevents web app class loaders from beeing garbage collected. The problem \nis that java beans information used by Struts is cached by \njava.beans.Introspector and never removed. A call to one of the methods \njava.beans.Introspector.flushCaches(), java.beans.Introspector.flushCaches\n(Class) or org.apache.commons.beanutils.PropertyUtilsBean.clearDescriptors() \nwould solve this.\n\nAfter doing a bit more searching I found that the Spring framework solves this \nproblem by providing a servlet context listener class \n(http://www.springframework.org/docs/api/org/springframework/web/util/Introspec\ntorCleanupListener.html) that calls Introspector.flushCaches() when a context \nis destroyed. \n\nTo test this, I modified the web.xml of the struts-examples web app to include \na listener definition using IntrospectorCleanupListener. After that I ran the \nWebPageConnector test program posted by James Norman on bug 32709. The program \nran over 1500 redeploys before i turned it off, at which time the memory \nconsumed by Tomcat (5.5) was about 30MB. Before the modification the program \ncould only run about 110 redeploys before an OutOfMemoryError occurred.\n",

Any other cool features like this in the JDK ?\n\nThe comment in the JDK source is hilarious:\n\n    /**\n     * Flush all of the Introspector's internal caches.
