This is not required but is\nuseful for quoting EL expressions.\n\nThis is currently not the case, as i can see a TODO in the src code.\n\n// TODO: only recognize \\$ if isELIgnored is false, but since\n// it can be set in a page directive, it cannot be determined\n// here.  Argh!\n\nNevertheless it's a bug i have run into, because my jsps contain many regular \nexpressions for javascript where the $ has to be escaped \\$, so it's not \ninterpreted as end of line in the regex.\n\nJohn",
