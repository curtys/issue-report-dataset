    "description": "The CGIServlet.java is erroneously adding 2 line feeds to the stdin stream of \nof a CGI process. The problem happens in the getPostInput() method. Even if no \nrequest parameters are present it will return a line feed. The calling method \nchecks for null, but based on the getPostInput method this can never occur. \nAdding the following code fixes the problem.\n\nprotected String getPostInput(Hashtable params) {\n...\nreturn qs.length() > 0 ? qs.append(lineSeparator).append(postInput).toString\n() : null;\n}\n\nThis only adds a line separator if parameters exist. I've also looked at the \nouput string which is formated as follows (example using 2 params):\n\n\"param1=value1&parma2=value2&\nparam1=value1\nparam2=value2\n\n\"\n\nIs this the expected output format? The problematic code also exists for \nversion 5.0.19.\n\nKevin",
