I'm not sure what\nversion of the sources you have used to build tomcat5.exe for 5.0.28, but it's\napparently from before that..\n\nI install it the way Bob described, and I can see the WorkingPath value set in\nthe registry for the Stop and Start subkeys, but the working path is completely\nignored.\n\nHowever, if I build procrun from top-of-tree sources for Commons Daemon and\nreplace tomcat5.exe with a copy of the prunsrvd.exe, workingpath works fine.\n\nCan you please pick up the latest prunsrvd and prunmgrd from Commons Daemon\nProcrun for the next release (5.0.29)? Thanks!",
