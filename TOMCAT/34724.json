I modified the\nimplementation in the suggested way (see the three new patches attachted) so the\ncookie domain can be set on the valve like\n\n<Valve className=\"org.apache.catalina.authenticator.SingleSignOn\"\ncookieDomain=\".mydomain.xa\"/>\n",

    "description": "I have the following setup:\n\n- Apache webserver in front of Tomcat 5.5.9\n- three 3rd-level domains www.mydomain.xa, search.mydomain.xa, my.mydomain.xa\n- Single Sign-On valve in Tomcat is activated\n- Login is handled by my.mydomain.xa and it's corresponding webapp under context /My\n\nThe problem with the SSO cookie created by Tomcat after successful login is that\nthe domain name stored with the cookie is my.mydomain.xa. Therefore the SSO\ncookie is not sent by the user agent if a request goes to www.mydomain.xa or\nsearch.mydomain.xa and single-sign on is not working for these subdomains.\n\nSo I need a way to tell tomcat to set '.mydomain.xa' as the domain of the SSO\ncookie so it will the sent by the user agent for all subdomains. Therefore I\nintroduced the system property 'tomcat.sso.cookie.domain' and added a few lines\nto AuthenticatorBase.java where the value of named system property is used - if\navailable - to set the SSO cookie's domain (see attached patch). The system\nproperty can be set in the startup script for example.",
