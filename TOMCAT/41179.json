The\nproblem is that this code is generic enough that you can't tell why\nrequest.getHost() returns null.  It could be a normal webapp redeployment, or it\ncould be an actual error.\n\nThinking about, it seems like a 404 SC_NOT_FOUND is the better response here,\nsince we couldn't find a virtual Host to service the request.",

    "description": "When you re-deploy the root war file using autoDeploy=\"true\", Tomcat sends a\nresponse with status code 400 (Bad Request: No host matches ...).\n\nThis makes it impossible to serve a custom error document with Apache + mod_jk\nsince the request processing is immediately halted to guard against security\nproblems caused by bad requests. (See:\nhttp://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html#errordocument)\n\nRFC 2616 (section 10.4.1) says about status code 400: \"The request could not be\nunderstood by the server due to malformed syntax. The client SHOULD NOT repeat\nthe request without modifications\"\n\nThe thing is, that there's nothing wrong with the client's request. It's not a\nsyntactical issue and indeed the client SHOULD repeat the request.\n\nI wonder whether a 404, 500 or 503 wouldn't be more appropriate here, at least\nthis would allow one to serve a custom error document during re-deployments.",
