At least, I note the following:\n\n1) Jasper's logging is configurable via a log4j.properties file\n2) Changing logVerbosityLevel doesn't have any effect that I can see\n3) I can't find any reference to logVerbosityLevel in the code\n\nIf logVerbosityLevel really isn't used anymore, it should be taken out of \nTomcat's web.xml and jasper-howto.xml.\n\nI will attach a patch that implements this, and corrects some minor spelling \nmistakes in both files.",
