I've not installed the complete source distribution in\nmy development environment, but it seems the points to change are \norg.apache.catalina.authenticator.AuthenticatorBase.register(...), the code of\ninterest being (from 5.5.30 source distribution)\n\n            Cookie cookie = new Cookie(Constants.SINGLE_SIGN_ON_COOKIE, ssoId);\n            cookie.setMaxAge(-1);\n            cookie.setPath(\"/\");\n            hres.addCookie(cookie);\n\nAs hres is an org.apache.catalina.HttpRequest, and I've looked through the code\nto find org.apache.catalina.Request.setSecure() but no ...isSecure() (though\nthis is mentioned in the Javadoc for ...setSecure()) I suppose there needs to be\nanother change to provide isSecure on Request or HttpRequest, but this is\ndifficult to tell only from the editor.\nIf isSecure() was there, there'd be a \n            cookie.setSecure(hres.isSecure()) \nmissing in the statements above...",
