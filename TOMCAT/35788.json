    "description": "I noticed the search box on the Tomcat FAQ recently.  Great idea!  While adding\n it to the Struts FAQ and User Guide, I discovered that it can be done without\nJavaScript by using the 'domains' and 'sitesearch' form elements.   (See:\nhttp://www.google.com/searchcode.html )\n\nThis also causes the results page to have radio buttons so the user can choose\nto restrict a second search to your site, and eliminates the 'inurl:' and\n'site:' showing in the text box.  \n\nI'm attaching a patch with those changes, and a little rearranging to put a\nlabel underneath the text box.",
