This will also occur if the <ant> task is used to call a sub-project in\nanother directory.\n\nThis is because uriRoot is resolved against the current working directory rather\nthan the basedir for the Project.\n\nAdding a setProject(Project) setter and if set, using project.getBaseDir() to\nresolve the uriRoot fixes this.  Will submit patch.",
