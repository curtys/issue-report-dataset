It is org.apache.jk.common.ChannelSocket\nclass, a part of Pure Java (Non-APR) AJP Connector.\nThe class has empty setBacklog(int i) method and always uses 0 for \nServerSocket backlog (0 means to use OS default value).",

    "description": "In configuring my AJP13 connector between Tomcat 5.5.9 and Apache2 (on Red Hat \nEnterprise 3 with Java 1.5) I am finding that the attribute named \"backlog\" \nseems to have no affect, while the attribute named \"acceptCount\" does.\n\nIn my original load/configuration testing for deployment I had copied existing \nConnector configuration in the server.xml file from other defined Connectors.  \nThese use the \"acceptCount\" attribute name to manipulate the size of the \npending request queue size.  However, the documentation for this same \nconfiguation specifies the use of \"backlog\", which does not appear to have an \neffect on performance.\n\nI have inquired the users group about this topic, but have had no reply.  \nSince I am seeing a performance change using \"acceptCount\", I can only assume \nat this time that the documentation is in error.\n\nSee http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/config/ajp.html",
