    "description": "Hi,\n\nfiles being created by the ExpandWar class have the creation date as the\nlastModified attribute. This makes a proper cache handling quite difficult,\nbecause the if-modified-since header increases after deploying, even if the\nfiles in question haven't changed.\n\nThe attached simple patch changes the behaviour. It would be nice, if the patch\ncould be accepted at least as a configurable option. If so, I'd be ready to work\non more details and supply a larger patch later on.\n\nRegards,\n\nJochen",
