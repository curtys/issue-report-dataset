I've added a patch in time for 5.5.17 that checks the\ndestination context config file is not null, indeed a file (as opposed to a\ndirectory), and writeable by Tomcat.  If these checks pass, all is well,\notherwise a diagnostic message is written to the log and an exception thrown\nbefore any file saving is done, so no corrupt server.xml will be written.",
