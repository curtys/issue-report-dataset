For example, the jsp files \"a(.jsp\" and \na_00028.jsp will be mapped to the same java class file. \n \nThe attached patch mangles all non-valid characters plus '_'. It also shortens \nthe mangled sequence. Chars range in value from \\u0000 to \\uFFFF, so only 4 \nhex digits are required, not 5. The total string length is 5 instead of 6. \n \n ",

Unfortunately, _ is a valid java identifier start character. \nSo, for example, 0.jsp and _0.jsp, will both be mapped to _0_jsp.java.  \n \nIn general, if _ is to be used as an escape character, _ needs to be escaped \nitself.",
