    "description": "If a cluster of nodes is being load balanced with sticky sessions, and a\nparticular node becomes unavailable, any sessions bound to that node must be\nredistributed.  Particularly in the case of mod_jk these sessions will not be\nbound to whichever node the failover occurred on because the jessionid will\nstill contain the JVM route of the original failed node, thus placing the\nsession in an indeterminate state and losing sticky properties.\n\nI am attaching a patch that will trigger a session to rebind itself to a new\nnode if the jvmroutes don't match and replace the jessionid in the browser's cookie.",
