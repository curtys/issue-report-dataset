If so I'd put that in the manual.\n\nI only ask because it causes a bit of a security problem. If you connect via\nApache-httpd and think you can rely on a connector/engine either matching a host\ndefined inside it, or defaulting to the default host inside it, you get a nasty\nshock if it happens to find a match on a totally different application somewhere\nelse, especially if you thought that application was secured. :(\n\nThanks for the prompt reply.",

    "description": "I have a TC 5.5 fronted by Apache2/mod_jk.\nTwo SSL sites on different ips, one for users, one for admins. The admin one is\napache password protected. Each apache ip virtual host uses a different worker\nto talk to TC on a different port in a different service. for example\n\n<Service name=\"User\">\n <Connector scheme=\"https\" secure=\"true\" address=\"127.0.0.1\" port=\"10004\"\ndebug=\"0\" useURIValidationHack=\"false\" protocol=\"AJP/1.3\"/>\n <Engine name=\"Standalone\" defaultHost=\"User\" debug=\"0\">\n  <Host name=\"User\" debug=\"0\" appBase=\"webapps/SomethingUser\" unpackWARs=\"false\">\n   <Context blahblah/>\n  </Host>\n </Engine>\n</Service>\n\n<Service name=\"Admin\">\n <Connector scheme=\"https\" secure=\"true\" address=\"127.0.0.1\" port=\"10005\"\ndebug=\"0\" useURIValidationHack=\"false\" protocol=\"AJP/1.3\"/>\n <Engine name=\"Standalone\" defaultHost=\"Admin\" debug=\"0\">\n  <Host name=\"Admin\" debug=\"0\" appBase=\"webapps/SomethingAdmin\" unpackWARs=\"false\">\n   <Context blahblah/>\n  </Host>\n </Engine>\n</Service>\n\nThe problem, and it may be intended behavior, is that if you connect to ip1 and\nspoof your Host header as 'Admin', apache correctly routes the request (jk in\ndebug says it connects via 10004) to TC via the User worker, but then TC appears\nto match the virtual host name in a different service and serves admin content\ngetting around Apache's password protection.\nVia browsing a lot of bugs tonight I'm aware of the useIPVHost element which I\ncould probably use to lock each host to the host apache intended, but this can't\nbe intended behaviour. Can it? Across Service tags? Why would you ever need more\nthan one service or connector then?\n\nHopefully at the very least this will spur a note in the docs. if it is\nintended, as this is potentially dangerous. LMK if you need anything else to\nreproduce.",
