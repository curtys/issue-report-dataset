    "description": "Couldn't find any documentation on Tomcat logging standards, but this feels like an \"info\" log level \nissue rather than a warning.  \n\nThe JSP 2.0 spec explicitly defines the following elements that TagLibraryInfoImpl will log warnings for \n(see section 3-18, Figure JSP.C-4):  description, display-name, icon.\n\nCan we get the logging from createTagFileInfo() changed to INFO level, please?  There's no warning here \n-- the TLDs are strictly conforming, the fact that jasper doesn't know what to do with these means I'd \nhave to raise my logging threshold, thereby potentially missing messages that actually matter.\n\nA better option would be to explicitly check for these three elements and ignore them, thus leaving the \nlog level at warning.",
