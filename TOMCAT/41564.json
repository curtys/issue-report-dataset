Vista normally runs everybody ( including administrators ) in a non-administrative mode.\nThis provides additional security and makes it more difficult for intruders to run programs requiring administrative privileges.\n\nCurrently, there are two possible workaround that allow to install the windows service successfully:\n\nThe first option - Temporary disable UAC\n1. Temporary disable UAC (restart of OS required). It is done from\n\n    * run \"msconfig\" > tools > disable UAC or\n    * Start > Control Panel > User Accounts > Turn User Account Control on or off\n1. Install Tomcat.\n      3. Enable UAC - as per 2.\n      4. Restart OS\n\nThe second option - create a bat file and execute it as admin\n\n   1. Create a bat file that installs the service as per http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/windows-service-howto.html\n   2. Click right button of mouse and select \"Run as administrator\"\n\nI've tried to initiate the installer with \"Run as administrator\", although it failed to install the service.",

Only actual .exe's can be associated.  There is a code elevation\nmodel for invoking programs as admin, see the am_RespawnAsUserAdmin() \nimplementation within the ApacheMonitor.exe app (which doesn't want to run-as\nadmin until it is absolutely required, and certainly not hang for a permission\nchange each time the user logs in!)  \nhttp://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/trunk/support/win32/ApacheMonitor.c",
