Symbolic link is\nchanged to point to myApp_version2:\n/foo/myApp_version1 (dir)\n/foo/myApp_version2 (dir)\n/foo/myApp -> /foo/myApp_version2 (symbolic link)\n\nand finally application myApp is started. The problem is that the displayed web\napplication is still the one contained in /foo/myApp_version1 (the initially\ntargeted folder)and not the one contained in /foo/myApp_version2.",
