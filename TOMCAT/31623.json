    "description": "The setclasspath.sh script contains some questionable syntax in several areas where the $os400 \nvariable is tested.\n\nThese errors lead to warnings from bash/sh if os400 is not set, and additionally mean that the \nfunctionality doesn't work as intended (i.e. the test of the os400 variable at one point assumes that it \nmay have a null/non-null value, and at another assumes that it will always have a valid value.\n\nThese changes add robustness by not assuming that os400 will always be set to a non-null value, and \ntest it only against \"true\" when testing whether it is true.\n\nPatch is attached.",
