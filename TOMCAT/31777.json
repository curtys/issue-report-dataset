    "description": "Tomcat 5.0.28 ran fine under Java 5, including compilation of JSP pages.\n\nTomcat 5.0.29 runs fine under Java 5 *except* that it cannot compile JSP pages.\n\nThe issue is that Tomcat 5.0.29 sets the 'target' JVM version to 1.3, but does\nnot set the option for Java source version.  The javac in JDK 1.5 defaults this\nto 1.5 -- and throws a fatal error given -target 1.3 and no -source specified\n(or -source 1.5, for that matter).\n\nThis is a substantial regression.",
