It can be achieved in various vendor specific \nways via tomcat customizations, but I would like to see inherent support for it. \nThe simplest approach would be a Realm attribute like \nauthenticationOnlyAllRolesMode=true allowing for an authenticated user access \nregardless of the role(s) they have been granted.",
