However, I'm not\nconvinced the behavior you're asking for is correct: does the RFC say 401\n(instead of 400, or more generally 4xx) is *required* for the case where a\nrequest has no certificates at all?\n\nIf you could point out the relevant spec part that makes this clear, we can\nchange the code.",

This is an authentication issue and has nothing to do with the\nrequest syntax.\n\nRFC 2616 says for 400 Bad Request:\n\"The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed\nsyntax.\"\n\nAs I stated before, a request that has no certificates attached (because there\nwere none in the browser keystore) is not malformed. This behavior is specified\nin the SSL RFC 2264\n\n\"7.4.6. Client certificate\n(...) If no suitable certificate is\navailable, the client should send a certificate message\ncontaining no certificates. (...)\"",
