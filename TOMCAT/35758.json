    "description": "Hi,\n\nI have a problem when configuring a JDBCRealm from the admin tool.\n\nI use no digest algorithm, so I leave the digest text field in blank, but the\ngenerated server.xml file includes an oughfull:\ndigest=\"\"\nattribute, so Tomcat throws me an exception telling me that it can not find the \nrequired (\"\") digest algorithm.\n\nI removed the offending line from server.xml and it works perfectly.\n\nUnfortunatelly, my hosting service only allow me to use the admin app. (As a \nworkaround, I included the META-INF/context.xml file with the right tags and it \nworked ok)\n\nHow can I tell from the admin app that don't generate the digest attribute?\nI already test it with: \"No\", \"NO\", \"NONE\" y \"null\" but doesn't work.\n\nI checked the source code and the SaveJDBCRealmAction Action class has the \nfollowing code in line 235:\n\nattribute = \"digest\";\nmBServer.setAttribute(roname,\n       new Attribute(\"digest\",  rform.getDigest()));\n\nMay it be guarded like this?\n\nif ( rform.getDigest() != null && !\"\".equals(rform.getDigest().trim()) ) {\n  attribute = \"digest\";\n  mBServer.setAttribute(roname,\n         new Attribute(\"digest\",  rform.getDigest()));\n}\n\nThanks in advance\nGabriel\n\nPS: Didn't check it but it may be worth to look at the code of DataSourceRealm \nsince it may have similar problems.-",
