See attached.\n\nThus, applications that put commons-logging.jar and log4.jar in their\nWEB-INF/lib will not be GC'ed on reloads, undeploys, and stops. This is a severe\nmemory leak for developer's using Tomcat for development.\n\nPlease see the attachment from the YourKit Profiler that confirms this finding.\n\nNote: it appears the last place in Tomcat's source code where this error occurs.\nOnce this is fixed, Tomcat will be fully \"developer-friendly\". :-)",
