For some\nreason still unknown to me JSSE isn't tolerant of mismatched case in the alias\nname when using a JCEKS keystore (with plain old JKS seems it doesn't give a\nwhit about case).  The aliases in a JCEKS keystore are downcased internally just\nlike in a JKS keystore, which is why changing your keyAlias to all lower case\nmakes the problem go away (try a 'keygen -list -v' on your keystore and you'll\nsee the alias name all lower case).\n\nI'm attaching patches for 5.0.x and 5.5.x that downcase the incoming alias name\nin the JSSEKeyManager constructor.  This eliminates the issue in my testing.",
