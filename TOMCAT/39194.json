Consistency is a good goal but\nin this case I think we may need to go the other way, i.e. remove tools.jar from\none script instead of adding it to the other.  Please bring this up on the\ntomcat dev mailing list for discussion.",

A new patch has been proposed which removes the javac option. tools.jar can be added to the classpath using the setenv script.",

    "description": "I have found out (the hard way) that on Unix tools.jar is not included in the\nclasspath, while in our Windows test envionment, it is.\n\nI need the java compiler accessible for a 3rd-party library, coincidently\ncalled Jasperreports.\n\nSince the documentation states that tools.jar _is_ available,  I would ask\nthat it is made so by correcting setclasspath.sh, which only puts\ntools.jar in the classpath for the 'debug' and 'javac' commands.\n\nThat is nt consistent with the behavior of setclasspath.bat on Windows,\nwhich always adds tools.jar.\n\nThanks!",
