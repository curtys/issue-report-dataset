    "description": "When org.apache.tomcat.util.threads.ThreadPool.shutdown() is called it\nterminates all the idle threads except one (the last one that became idle). The\nproblem is that the mentioned method explicitly leaves that thread behind. That\ncan be easily seen (using a debugger) when tomcat is shutting down. In order to\nsolve the problem a very small correction is needed. In the mentioned method the\nline:\n\n    for(int i = 0 ; i < (currentThreadCount - currentThreadsBusy - 1) ; i++) {\n\nshould become:\n\n    for(int i = 0 ; i < (currentThreadCount - currentThreadsBusy) ; i++) {\n\nso that the loop would iterate over all the idle thread without exception.",
