If you disagree with my resolution, please\nbring this forward to the servlet specification, and persuade them to make the\nnecessary specification changes.\n\nBTW, I disagree with what you point out. What you want is actually a shared\nsession across all contexts. Again, this is a blatant misconception on the part\nof the portlet specification and its design, since all the servlet specification\never said was that a separate session object would be returned for each context,\nwith no further precisions.",
