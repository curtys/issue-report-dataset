It had to be \"access\".\n   (Anyways I worked it around with tableName = \"accesslogs\" in the server.xml)\n\nI had to strip down the table struct to this \n\nCREATE TABLE accesslogs (\n id VARCHAR(255),\n remoteHost CHAR(15),\n userName CHAR(15),\n timestamp TIMESTAMP,\n virtualHost VARCHAR(64),\n method VARCHAR(8),\n query VARCHAR(255),\n status SMALLINT,\n bytes INT,\n referer VARCHAR(128),\n userAgent VARCHAR(128)\n  );\n\nCan this valve provide fix for the default table struct?\n\nAlso, the valve fails to log in the Oracle DB if I use the following pattern \n\npattern=\"Combined Log Format: %{X-Forwarded-For}i %a %h %q %v %D %T %l %u %t %r %s %b %{User-Agent}i %{Referer}i\"\n\nIt works well for pattern=\"combined\"",
