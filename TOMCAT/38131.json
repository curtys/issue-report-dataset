That\nmethod will loop over the declared WatchedResources for the Context and try to\ncreate a java.io.File corresponding to each WatchedResource for monitoring.  As\nyou can see from the code, it either wants an absolute path to the\nWatchedResource, or a docBase relative to which the WatchedResource can be found.\n\nI'm guessing in your case the docBase is relative, not absolute, so the method\nuses appBase as the context for docBase, and since your webapp is outside\nappBase this doesn't work.  Is my guess right?  Does it work if you make your\ndocBase absolute?",

            "body": "In my tests using tomcat 6.0.13, JDK 1.6, when the path in the WatchedResource\nis relative path, the absolute path interpreted by the code as written for the\nrelative path will be an absolute path to relative to the JVM startup directory.\nObviously something is very quirky in there. Since the path will then most\nlikely point to an invalid resource, it will not be watched and there is no\nwarning give to the user either. In this case addWatchedResource is given a\n'null' docBase.\n\nThe code in question is in HostConfig.deployDescriptor().\n\nSuggested code improvements:\no for descriptors that explicitly specify an absolute docBase, pass it to the\naddWatchedResource method instead of 'null'\no print warning if watched resource evaluated path points to a resource that\ndoes not exist\n\nI came up with a fix but I was discouraged to not find any existing unit tests\nto verify regression. If there are any please tell me so I can verify the patch.\n",
