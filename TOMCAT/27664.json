Specifying a\njsp-property-group with url-pattern '/*' now effectively disables all welcome\nfiles in the application.\n\nAn example from the JSP spec (1-90):\n\n<jsp-property-group>\n   <url-pattern>/ja/*</url-pattern>\n   <page-encoding>Shift_JIS</page-encoding>\n</jsp-property-group>\n\nThe Japanese target audience would probably not be very happy with the fact that\nany welcome files below '/ja/*' stopped functioning. I'm reopening this bug.",
