            "body": "The white-space issue isn't much of an issue.  In the mods I made, I just made \nsure that anything in common between the web.xml from Tomcat-4.1.18 and Tomcat-\n5.0 looked exactly the same.  Since Tomcat-4.1.18 is the stable side of things, \nI made the web.xml of Tomcat-5.0 match that of Tomcat-4.1.18.  In the case of \nwhite-space, this means that if the web.xml of Tomcat-5.0 had an extra tab at \nthe end of a line where it didn't in Tomcat-4.1.18, I removed it to make it \nmatch Tomcat-4.1.18's web.xml.  To see what I am talking about, perform a diff \non the old Tomcat-5.0 web.xml and compare it to that of Tomcat-4.1.18.  Notice \nthe differences where there really shouldn't be any?\n\nDoes that make sense?  It may seem pedantic, but it makes it easier to perform \ndiff's on the files so that it is easier to keep them in sync.  Again, not a \nbig issue, but I figured I might as well fix it while I was making other more \nmeaningful changes.  Thanks for applying the changes!\n\nJake",
