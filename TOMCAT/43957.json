    "description": "If Tomcat is unpacked from the zip file and started manually, all the log files\nspecified in logging.properties are created - admin.DATE.log, catalina.DATE.log,\nand so on.\n\nIf Tomcat is installed using the Windows Service Installer, and the service is\nstarted, the log files are also created correctly.\n\nHowever, if Tomcat is unpacked from the zip file and installed as a service\n(using 'service install'), and the service is started, the log files aren't\ncreated. This is due to two JVM options that aren't set up -\njava.util.logging.manager and java.util.logging.config.file.\n\nFor consistency, service.bat should set these options, like the Windows\ninstaller does. The attached patch fixes this.",
