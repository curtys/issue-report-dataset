Connect to this tomcat and cookies will be used to store session info.\n3. change cookies=false and restart tomcat\n4. Connect again using the same user and browser as in #2 note that cookies are\nstill being used. --> This is the bug (should use URL-Rewrite)\n5. connect using a new user/browser and URL rewrite is used.\n\nIf cookes=false is set then URL rewrite should always be used (and the session\nshould not be stored in a cookie) regardless of where the initial session id\ncame from.",
