    "description": "When using the security manager with the default security policy (catalina.policy), Tomcat 5.5.26 and 5.5.27 will throw an AccessControlException for each loaded context during startup.\n\nWorkaround\n----------\n\nCheck the contents of the files WEB-INF/lib/logging.properties for each of your contexts. If those look safe, you can add read permission for these files to the juli package in your security policy. See \"per context logging\" in catalina.policy. Note that by CVE-2007-5342 you should make sure, that the webapp provided logging.properties do not try to manipulate data outdise of the context, like overwriting other contexts log files.\n\nFix\n---\n\nA fix has been proposed for backport from trunk. It will log the situation and no longer throw an exception.\n\nThis issue is meant as a reference for users running into the problem. It should be closed after the backport.",
