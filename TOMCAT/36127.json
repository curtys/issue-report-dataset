    "description": "Hi,\n\nWhen using Tomcat with the last xerces version (2.7.1), there is a problem on\njsp validation. (Note that next Tomcat version will have also 2.7.1 version (as\nit was put in the changelog) in current CVS tree).\n\nOne way to fix it is in the org/apache/jasper/compiler/JspDocumentParser.java file.\nBy replacing :\n\n        factory.setFeature(\n            \"http://xml.org/sax/features/validation\",\n            validating);\n\nby :\n\n       factory.setValidating(validating);\n\n(Patch at the end)\n\nNote that the setValidating() method is also used by digester which is used by\nTomcat as other places.\nSee getFactory() method.\nhttp://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/jakarta-commons/digester/src/java/org/apache/commons/digester/Digester.java?view=markup\n\nI provide a sample (you could extract the xml snippet if you want to test it in\nTomcat directly without the sample Class).\nI tried this example with Sun JDK 1.4.2_08, JDK 5_update4 and with xerces 2.6.2\nand 2.7.1 (with endorsed java -Djava.endorsed.dirs=...) and with \nfactory.setValidating(validating); it works in all cases. (like in Digester).\n\n\nIt will be fine if it could be fixed in CVS for next Tomcat version.\n\nRegards,\n\nFlorent\n\n\nIndex: JspDocumentParser.java\n===================================================================\nRCS file:\n/home/cvspublic/jakarta-tomcat-jasper/jasper2/src/share/org/apache/jasper/compiler/JspDocumentParser.java,v\nretrieving revision 1.84\ndiff -u -r1.84 JspDocumentParser.java\n--- JspDocumentParser.java\t30 Mar 2005 20:27:22 -0000\t1.84\n+++ JspDocumentParser.java\t10 Aug 2005 15:22:04 -0000\n@@ -1370,9 +1370,10 @@\n         factory.setFeature(\n             \"http://xml.org/sax/features/namespace-prefixes\",\n             true);\n-        factory.setFeature(\n-            \"http://xml.org/sax/features/validation\",\n-            validating);\n+        factory.setValidating(validating);\n \n         // Configure the parser\n         SAXParser saxParser = factory.newSAXParser();\n\n \n         // Configure the parser\n         SAXParser saxParser = factory.newSAXParser();",
