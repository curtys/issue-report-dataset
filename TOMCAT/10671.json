So by default now (in 4.1.x) the behavior is to URLEncode the parameter\nvalues automatically?\n\nI ran into an issue with passing URLS as paramters where the invalid characters\n(for a url), when not escaped, would effectively \"hide\" any further parameters\nfrom being parsed. In ServletExec 3.1 the URLEncode step is automatically done.\nSo it sounds like this was also added to Tomcat 4.1.x?\n\n",

            "body": "I lately ran into ALMOUST the same URL encoding decoding problem.\nAs it seems no action is going to be taken I'll describe my situation so it\ncould help in the desition making.\n\nFirst I need to put ISO-8859-4 characters on the URL (I know it's bad design and\nthe next time I'll use underlying coding ;). For example the URL to be encoded\nis: \"folder.do?path=/Uusim/t\u00e4piline\".\n\nNow I use struts for createing the actual URL and so the URL is encoded in\nUTF-8. When tomcat decodes the request URL on the next step useing platform\ndefaul encodeing ISO-8859-4 I get different result.\n\nAs you all can see the problem could even be none of Tomcat's business but while\nfiguring about the solutions I came up with a little example that makes it\nTomcat's problem:\n\nLets assume that I encode the url with URLEncoder.encode(java.lang.String)\nmanually. Then struts will not find any unaceptable characters and leaves the\nURL alone (At least I hope so). Now I shouldn't have no problems with Tomcat's\ndecodeing method.\n\nBut the same problem comes up again when my application is distributed and the\nurl location happens to be on a different server with a different encodeing. Now\nwhen the different server happens to be out of my hands and so the encodeing\nremains different then I'll have to deal with the encoding problem on\napplication level and that's a bit stupid.\n\nSo my opinion is that the URL encodeing and decodeing should allways be done in\nUTF-8 encodeing like the \"World Wide Web Consortium\" recommends. And maybe\nintroduce a configuration parameter for extreme cases when some other server\nhandles this issue incorrectly.\n\nI'd be happy to get any response concering this issue.\n\nPS! I also checked and think that this problem is currently up with both the\n4.1.27 and 5.0.12 server versions.",

    "description": "This is related to bug 9361, which I also filed, but I have now run across a \nnumber of more substantive, related issues.\n\nTomcat 4.1.3 (and 4.1.2 and I'm not sure how far previously) take:\n  <jsp:include ....>\n    ...\n    <jsp:param name=\"foo\" value=\"<%=bar%>\"/>\n    ...\nand generate something like\n  JspEngine.include( ... + \"&foo=\" + java.net.URLEncoder.encode( bar ) ... );\nwhereas Tomcat 3.x did something like\n  JspEngine.include( ... + \"&foo=\" + bar ... );\n[Yes, I know the class is not actually \"JspEngine\", but you get the idea.]\n\nThis was apparently done to fix issues when bar.toString()'s result contained \n&, =, or other special characters.\n\nUnfortunately, this change has a number of critical issues:\n  1) As per 9361, if 'bar' is null, then this throws an exception, whereas most\n     every servlet engine around (including Tomcat 3.2.x and 3.3.x) do not.\n  2) If 'bar' is not a String, then the JSP page will no longer compile,\n     whereas non-String variables could be used in this context previously and\n     in other JSP engines.\n  3) java.net.URLEncoder.encode() does not properly handle non-ASCII or at\n     least non-Latin characters.  One has to do something like get the string\n     bytes as per UTF8 then URLEncode the string formed from these bytes\n     (interpretting each byte as a char) -- or more efficiently do this all in\n     a single pass.  Thus the original intent of using URLEncoder.encode() is\n     not fully accomplished by the change anyway.\n\nAs it stands now, Tomcat 4.1.x seriously cripples jsp:param as it is commonly \nused.  If this is as per the JSP 1.2 spec, please point this out (though I'd \nhave trouble believing this).\n\nI strongly suggest a single\n  String JspEngine.encode( Object obj )\nmethod that will return \"\" for a null object and otherwise to obj.toString(), \nUTF8 encode and URL encode this result.\n\nAs it is now, I suspect we were better off overall with the Tomcat 3.x \njsp:param code generation, i.e. a heck of a lot of big, real apps run just fine \non it without running afoul of URL encoding issues.",
