However there are no links at all when the connector element is \nmentioned.  At first I thought that there *was* no connector page, then I \nrealised that in fact there are two, but you have to click in the left margin.\n\nSuggestions:\n1. add a \"connector\" page to the reference, which explains that there are more \nthan one type, with a link to each.\n2. as with other server config elements, link each mention of connector within \nthe reference to the new page.",
