    "description": "I had a webapp running on a tomcat 5.0.28 and visible through the ajp/1.3\nconnector via apache\nThis webapp generates urls to itself with // in them. When it is configured to\naccess the tomcat via the http connector it works correctly, but when it is\nconfigured to operate via the ajp connector, the url is not reached.\nI've noticed that this webapps works correctly on mod_jk 1.2.5.\nI've had this problem on mod_jk 1.2.10\nHaving spent all the day to debug this problem, I think I've figured where it hides.\nThe code in mod_jk.c uses ap_no2slash(clean_uri) to remove double slashes in\njk_translate(). I think this happens registering workers base url to be fetched\nlater at the time to forward the uris.\nAdding an ap_no2slash() in /jk/native/common/jk_uri_worker_map.c seems to fix\nthe problem. I don't know if this is right, because I've got almost no knowledge\nof jk or apache internals. But now it seems to be working.
