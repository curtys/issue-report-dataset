I have checked some code\nand found a bug in creating an JNDIRealm. The signature of\ncreateJNDIRealm in MBeanFactory.java is not enough, it only has one\nparameter called parent, if we want to create an JNDIRealm through JMX,\nwe need another three parameters, they are\nConnectionURL,ConnectionName,ConnectionPassword.If we provide this\ninformation, the JNDIRealm can be initialized correctly,so you can set\nother attribute to the realm.\n   Attachments are the patches for admin webapp and the MBeanFactory\nmodification with tc5.5.x, I have tested it, and it can work now,\n  Another improvement is I add createJAASRealm in MBeanFactory for\ntomcat source code didn't contain creating JAASRealm JMX API,so I add\nit, it can work too.\n   \n  The above problem I haven't fire a bug in bugzilla, if it's necessary,\nI can do it.\n\n  Thanks.\n\nTerry Zhou",
