Please take a look at the readme for some instructions about\ninstallation and execution.\n\nHere some comments about the generell idea of the test:\n\nServlet 1 includes Servlet2 in a cross context environment. It gets a dispatcher\nby \"coServletContext.getRequestDispatcher(coServletPath)\".\nServlet2 gets a new session on the first request and invalidates this session by\n\"httpSession.invalidate()\" and tests the invalidation by\n\"httpServletRequestWrapper.isRequestedSessionIdValid()\" on the second request.\n\"isRequestedSessionIdValid()\" returns \"true\" instead of \"false\", which is a bug\n from my point of view.\n\nWhat do you think? Thank you in advance for your help.",
