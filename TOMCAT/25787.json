Please include a test case if you still have problems.\n\nNote also that the addition of <%@ attribute name=\"xxx\" fragment=\"true\" %> to\nthe tag file will not have any effect on the generated .class file, unless the\nfragment is also used in the tagfile, with an <jsp:invoke fragment=\"xxx\"/>. \nThis is just an optimization.\n\n",

It would be very inconvenient during development\nto have to redeploy the webapp every time an included file or a tagfile is\nmodified.\n\nThe dependencies are considered only when a JSP page is referenced and we are\ndeciding whether the page needs to be recompiled, so when development is false,\nthey are totally out of the picture.  At least I hope they are.  ;)",
