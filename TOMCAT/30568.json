This works for me on Solaris and RHEL by \nfollowing the Tomcat docs, no problem.\n\nbootstrap.jar includes commons-daemon.jar in its manifest Class Path.  If \ncommons-daemon.jar is in the same directory with the proper file permissions, \nyou should have no problem with this.  If you do have a problem, it's a \nconfiguration or installation issue, not a Tomcat bug.\n\nFinally, please use separate Bugzilla issues for separate bugs, don't combine \nthem.  For example, the ./configure script bug you report should be a separate \nissue.  (That one as I mentioned I can't test because I don't have a Gentoo \nsystem).  Thanks.\n",

    "description": "There are multiple defects.  Some are likely to be defects with the Gentoo \ndistribution of Tomcat5, and at least one of the defects (documented below) is \nin Catalina.  For the history of installation issues, see the following two \nURLS:\n\n  http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=208259\n  http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=59899\n\nI spotted another report of this issue in an Apache mailing list:\n\n  http://www.mail-archive.com/commons-dev@jakarta.apache.org/msg30457.html\n\nSkipping the installation issues (because they may be in the scope of the \nGentoo folks), I will go right to the problem that results following a manual \ninstall as per the Tomcat documentation.\n\nExecution of:\n\n    cd $CATALINA_HOME\n    ./bin/jsvc -Djava.endorsed.dirs=./common/endorsed -cp ./bin/bootstrap.jar \\\n        -outfile ./logs/catalina.out -errfile ./logs/catalina.err \\\n        org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap\n\nResults in:\n\n  jsvc.exec error: Cannot find daemon loader \n    org/apache/commons/daemon/support/DaemonLoader\n  jsvc.exec error: Service exit with a return value of 1\n\nI see no reason why jsvc would not be able to find the Daemon Loader.  The JAR \nfile is in the $CATALINA_HOME/bin folder, and looking at the table of contents \nreveals the class that jsvc cannot find.\n\nAlso, it may still be worthwhile to look at the Gentoo installation issues, \nbecause the ./configure script that comes packaged with Tomcat fails when \nuname -m returns \"ppc64\".",
