It absolutely prevents using the native library. I'd also recommend changing the very misleading (i.e., wrong) message that appears when not operating in DEBUG level. Just moving the getField invocations ahead of the org.apache.tomcat.jni.SSL code fixes the problem.\n\nHere's the ed script for the path:\n\n91,93d\n83a\n\n                major = clazz.getField(\"TCN_MAJOR_VERSION\").getInt(null);\n                minor = clazz.getField(\"TCN_MINOR_VERSION\").getInt(null);\n                patch = clazz.getField(\"TCN_PATCH_VERSION\").getInt(null);\n.\n\n\nThanks.\n\nRoy",

    "description": "I tried to add the Tomcat Native library to tomcat 5.5.28.\nAfter compiling the library and configuring tomcat to use it, I still got the same message (the library is not found).\nI changed the log level to finest for the class org.apache.catalina.core.AprLifecycleListener to get more details about the problem and I got:\njava.lang.NoSuchFieldException: TCN_MAJOR_VERSION\n\tat java.lang.Class.getField(Class.java:1507)\n\tat org.apache.catalina.core.AprLifecycleListener.lifecycleEvent(AprLifecycleListener.java:91)\n\t...\n\nWhen I looked the source code (5.5.28), I can see that the lifecycleEvent function does:\n1. load the class org.apache.tomcat.jni.Library into the variable clazz\n2. invoke 'initialize' on clazz\n3. load the class org.apache.tomcat.jni.SSL into the same variable clazz\n4. invoke 'randSet' on clazz\n5. get field 'TCN_MAJOR_VERSION' of clazz (line 91)\n\nThe step 5 throws the exception: there is no field TCN_MAJOR_VERSION in org.apache.tomcat.jni.SSL.\n\nI guess that this field should be retrieved from org.apache.tomcat.jni.Library, not org.apache.tomcat.jni.SSL (move step 5 before step 3)\n\nCheers,\nNicolas",
