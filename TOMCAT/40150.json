It verifies if the class exists, and if it implements\njava.security.Principal. If not, it logs a message (severe), that allows users\nto detect the incorrect class name.\n\nIt might even be better if it threw an exception.\n\nI've also restructured the code to parse the comma-delimited class name string,\nas it was rather inefficient. It uses a StringTokenizer now.",

The result is that during authentication, when the\nsubject's principals are checked against the configured class names, the\nprincipals are not recognised, and therefore not added to the subject.\n\nThe fact an incorrect configured class name is currently not detected and logged\nmakes it very hard to find the source of the problem. It can be easily fixed by\nchecking the class names in the two methods mentioned above. The class must\nexist, and it must implement java.security.Principal, which is currently not\nenforced/checked by the code.",
