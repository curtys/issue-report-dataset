However the\ndefinition of whitespace is not the same as that of Java. The formfeed character\nis NOT a whitespace character in XML, and is in Character.isSpace(). The JSP\nspec actually calls these out literally.\n\nYes, this is anal. I was only looking at it because isSpace is also happens to\nbe a deprecated method.\n\nPatch will be attached.",
