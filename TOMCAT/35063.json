    "description": "Hi,\n\nBecause \n- there is a lot of informations on several documents for deploying a webapp in\nTomcat 5.5 and often questions on the mailing list, \n- many things have changed in Tomcat 5.5,\n- I had no answer to my recent post on tomcat-user mailing list, \n\nI wrote a document \"HowTO deploy on a production server\" and an example to do\nthis as standard and simple as possible.\n\nCan you help me to validate (correct and/or complete) this ?\nEventually, could you integrate such a document in a future Tomcat documentation ?\n\nNotes : \n- The doc HowTo is in the tgz, under doc/HowtoDeployForProduction.html\n- The goal of this document is only to be a \"as simple as possible\" starting\npoint for this theme.\n- If you don't want to integrate it, can you give me a validation ?",
