This may create problems for some people who\ndepend on the incorrect usage of this function. Plus, there may be a better\nsolution, such as always returning an input stream containing \"42\"",

    "description": "Say for example, you have a file style.css deployed in your context. The call to\nServletContext.getResourceAsStream(\"style.css\") returns an input stream. This is\nnot correct behavior.\n\nThe spec (2.3) says:\n\n> The path must be specified according to \n> the rules given in getResource. \n\ngetResource() says:\n\n> The path must begin with a \"/\" and is interpreted \n> as relative to the current context root.\n\nMy reading of these two things is that getResourceAsStream(\"style.css\") should\nreturn null, not an input stream to the file.\n\nI got bit on this because my app behavior changed (broke) when ran on the\ncurrent version of WebSphere.",
