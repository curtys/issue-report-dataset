    "description": "A propfind call on a resource returns a 404 error when executed after a mkcol for the same resource. The mkcol should be preceeded with a propfind to trigger the issue. \n\nSteps to reproduce - See the following access log;\n  127.0.0.1 - - [06/Jan/2011:14:09:19 +0100] \"PROPFIND /webdav/output/f469e3d6-e536-4072-82da-d989acaf57a2/ HTTP/1.1\" 404 1084\n  127.0.0.1 - - [06/Jan/2011:14:09:19 +0100] \"MKCOL /webdav/output/f469e3d6-e536-4072-82da-d989acaf57a2/ HTTP/1.1\" 201 -\n  127.0.0.1 - - [06/Jan/2011:14:09:19 +0100] \"PROPFIND /webdav/output/f469e3d6-e536-4072-82da-d989acaf57a2/ HTTP/1.1\" 404 1084\n\nWhen the first request would be omitted, the third request would have been succesful, as the following access log shows;\n  127.0.0.1 - - [06/Jan/2011:14:10:39 +0100] \"MKCOL /webdav/output/81a97360-ea49-44d3-b764-d8c7e60e885e/ HTTP/1.1\" 201 -\n  127.0.0.1 - - [06/Jan/2011:14:10:39 +0100] \"PROPFIND /webdav/output/81a97360-ea49-44d3-b764-d8c7e60e885e/ HTTP/1.1\" 207 628\n\nNote: After a few seconds, the response to propfind for that resource is OK again. This suggests this has to do with caching.\n\nNote2: This situation sounds similar to call 21288 (FIXED - 'DirContext caching problem with Dreamweaver 6 when recursively creating directories').\n\nReproducable using a jackrabbit client;\n\n____\n    HttpClient client = new HttpClient();\n\n    String newDir = \"http://localhost:8080/webdav/output/\" + UUID.randomUUID() + \"/\";\n\n    // Comment out this request to make second propfind succesful\n    HttpMethod propFindMethod1 = new PropFindMethod(newDir);\n    client.executeMethod(propFindMethod1);\n    propFindMethod1.releaseConnection();\n\n    HttpMethod mkcolMethod = new MkColMethod(newDir);\n    client.executeMethod(mkcolMethod);\n    mkcolMethod.releaseConnection();\n\n    HttpMethod propFindMethod = new PropFindMethod(newDir);\n    client.executeMethod(propFindMethod);\n    propFindMethod.releaseConnection();\n____",
