This\ndoes not work - a Google search has revealed a number of people with this\nproblem, and there is at least one bug report open.\n\nThe correct place (as in \"the place where it works\") to put <resources> is in\nthe <GlobalNamingResources> section, which goes under <Server>.\n\nA further problem with the HOWTO is consistency with regards to datasource\nnaming. Under the postgres section, the datasource is first named\n\"jdbc/postgres\", then it is named \"jdbc/mydb\" under web.xml. This is confusing\nto first time users.\n\nIn order to get Realms to work, the realm must refer to the datasource as\ndefined in the <globalnamingresources> section, not a datasource as renamed\nusing <resourcelink>. This is not made clear in the HOWTO.\n",

I added it under the context for my \napp, not in the global.\nHowever, this was almost a catch-22 because the admin interface would \ndump \"cannot find driverName\" if there wasn't a resource already defined.\nSo I went directly to the server.xml file and added a \"dummy\" resource, then \nthe admin interface would allow me to modify the url, login, etc.\nThen it worked.\nFor awhile.\nNow it seems that when i have ant pop the war file for my app into the tomcat \nwebapps dir, and delete the folder for my app under the  webapps dir, i get the \nnaming problem after restart.\n\nDo i have to be locked into the admin interface?\nwhatever\n",
