I was thinking that you were trying to stop init being called \ntwice (which doesn't seem possible with the current JMX-deployment scheme).\n\nYou're patch is still sending the JMX Notification twice, so by the time you \nadd that, it seemed much simplier to simply do:\n  if( initialized ) {\n      return;\n  }\nSo that is what got committed to the CVS, and will appear in 5.5.13.",

    "description": "Using JBoss 4.0.2 (With embeded Tomcat 5.5.9) when a web application is deployed\nthe context is initialised twice.  If you deploy a web application with a valve\ndefined in 'WEB-INF/context.xml' of the application the valve will be registered\ntwice and invoked twice for any invocation of the application.\n\nWhen Tomcat is run stand alone the deployer instantiates a new StandardContext\nand adds it as a child to the StandardHost, this in turn invokes the init method\nof the StandardContext - This correctly initialses the context based on the\nconfiguration.\n\nWhen Tomcat is embeded in JBoss the StandardContext is initialised, the host at\nthis stage is not available so JBoss invokes init on the StandardContext.  At\nthe top of the init method the context checks if it is associated with a parent\nhost as it is not the parent host is identified and the StandardContext added to\nthe parent.  The process of adding the context to the host causes the init\nmethod of the context to be invoked again.\n\nAlthough I have reported this against an older Tomcat version the affected code\nhas not been altered in the recent releases.\n\nI will attach a patch that contains a proposed fix.  The proposed fix simply\nchecks if the context has been initialised before performing the initialisation,\nif the initialisation has already been performed the initialisation is skipped.",
