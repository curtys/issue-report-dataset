    "description": "First off all this report is not about the stuff discussed in\nhttp://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16001. I am not complaining\nabout the relase method not being called between different invocations of a tag.\nThis is correct and spec compliant.\n\nAs far as I understand the specs the JSP environment must guarantee that release\nis called at least ONCE during the lifetime of a tag instance. If this tag is\npooled this is done in the _jspDestroy method, but if tag pooling is disabled I\nsee no call to release.\nI was forced to turn off the pooling because the 3rd party who created the\napplication did implement its tags in a NON spec compliant way such that private\ninternal data does not get reseted correctly for subsequent calls of the same\ntag instance. I just want to be sure that release is also called in this non\npooling case.\n\nRegards\n\nR\u00fcdiger",
