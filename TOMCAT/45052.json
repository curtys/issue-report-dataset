    "description": "The current Manager webapp provides functionality to change settings. However, in many cases users are allowed to view Tomcat settings but are not allowed to change them. This tool is an excellent way of providing detailed information, but access is not granted for read only usage because it is not possible to easily configure this.\n\nPlease allow an 'admin-read-only' kind of role to have access to the Manager in a read only mode. Name of the role is to be decided by development community but 'audit' would cover it sufficiently.\n\nActions like \"Start\", \"Stop\", \"Reload\", \"Undeploy should not appear when a user with this read only role is logged in. Also the deploy form should not be shown.\n\nImplementing this enhancement will lead to more satisfied use of Tomcat, especially in complex and overly protected environments where this read only mode (where normal admin mode is not allowed) enable better access into configuration settings.\n\nThe same request has been made for the Administration Tool webapp.",
