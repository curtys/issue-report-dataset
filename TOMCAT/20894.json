However, this is technically\ninvalid, and the JSP 2.0 specification will now say that it such a TLD will be\nconsidered invalid.\n\nIt would be very helpful for tag library developers if Tomcat can flag such an\nerror right away and indicate that the TLD is invalid for that reason.  This can\ntake the form of a translation error, for example.  This would be symmetrical\nwith the current treatment of body-content=\"JSP\" in Tag Files (which is\ncurrently explicitly required to produce a translation error).",
