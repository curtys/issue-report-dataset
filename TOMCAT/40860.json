As i observe, the recycle must set to false! There is a finally clause\nthat force the recycle! I supose that or the recycle may throw an exception or\nan other process is accessing the request object.",

    "description": "Hi,\n\nI\u2019m having a problem with parameters loses in tomcat. It\u2019s an intermittent\nproblem. That occurs when I do some ajax\u2019s request and then I do one or more\nform submissions. \n\nI put the tomcat in debug mode and  I observed the class CoyoteAdapter \u2013 the\nmethod service(). There exists a request variable (CoyoteRequest type) that has\na protected variable requestParametersParsed that is a flag to parse or not\nparse the parameters of a post or get. In the end of the method exists a\n\u2018finally\u2019 clause that force the request variable to do a recycle. The recycle\nforces the requestParametersParsed variable to change to false. Then in the next\nutilization of the class the parameters will be parsed again. \n\nThe problem that I\u2019ve found is in some situations (as described at the start)\nthe requestParametersParsed variable is true and the parameters are not parsed. \n\nThe consequence of this is that in my servlet when I ask request.getParameter(\u2026)\nand it returns null but in my query string or in my post data has the parameter.\nThe prove of that is when I ask request.getQueryString() and it returns a not\nempty string with my parameter.\n\nEx:\n\nrequest.getQueryString() = servlet?param=x\nrequest.getParameter(\u2018param\u2019) = null\n\n\nSee a pierce of the method service of CoyoteAdapter:\n \n    public void service(Request req, Response res)\n        throws Exception {\n\n\u2026\n        try {\n\n            // Parse and set Catalina and configuration specific\n            // request parameters\n            if ( postParseRequest(req, request, res, response) ) {\n                // Calling the container\n                connector.getContainer().invoke(request, response);\n            }\n\n\u2026\n        } finally {\n            // Recycle the wrapper request and response\n            request.recycle();\n            response.recycle();\n        }\n\n    }\n\nAt line \u201cif postParseRequest(\u2026\u201d the request. requestParametersParsed must be\nfalse but in some situations it is true!\n\nI cant find the cause of the problem but I found the problem. To resolve my\nproblem I put a request.recycle(); before the line to force the\nrequestParametersParsed  variable to false.\nI don\u2019t want to have a tomcat modified by me. Its not good. \n\nSee the post\nhttp://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/tomcat-dev/200601.mbox/%3C43D11EAA.1090905@amazon.com.br%3E\nHe is having the same problem.\n\nThanks\n\nThiago",
