    "description": "In the \"Digested Passwords\" section of the documentation is states:\n    * If you want to execute a command line utility to calculate the digested\npassword, simply execute\n\njava org.apache.catalina.realm.RealmBase \\\n    -a {algorithm} {cleartext-password}\n\n      and the digested version of this cleartext password will be returned to\nstandard output.\n\nHowever, RealmBase no longer has a main() method as was the case in Tomcat 3 and 4.\n\nThe proposed fix would be simply to copy the code from the previous release into\nthe release 5 codebase but I wouldn't presume to do so.   Thanks.",
