    "description": "DataSourceRealm.java declares two StringBuffers fields, preparedRoles and\npreparedCredentials, that hold the SQL to be used. After these fields are\nassigned they do not change but to use them StringBuffer.toString() must be\ncalled. The toString method is synchronized and creates a new String instance\neach time it's called.\n\nThe simple fix is to change those fields to Strings and update the start()\nmethod, and remove the toString() calls in credentials(...) and roles(...) methods.\n\nA better, more intrusive, fix is to take advantage of PreparedStatements like\nJDBCRealm does.",
