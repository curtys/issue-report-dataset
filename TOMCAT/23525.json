    "description": "The Servlet Specification 2.4 Final Draft 3 says on chapter SRV.15.1.14.1 \n(page 284 in PDF document) when the method \"sessionDestroyed\" of an \nimplementor of HttpSessionListener should be invoked:\n\npublic void sessionDestroyed(HttpSessionEvent se)\n--> Notification that a session is about to be invalidated. <--\n                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThis is new and completely different comparing to the Servlet 2.3 specification\n(!) and means to me that the container first invokes \nHttpSessionListener.sessionDestroyed() and after that invalidate (destroy) the \nsession.\nAt the moment Tomcat 5 behaves like the Servlet 2.3 specification, which means \nthat the container invalidates the session and after that invoke \nHttpSessionListener.sessionDestroyed().\n\nI think Tomcat's behaviour must be changed according to the 2.4 specification!\n\nBtw: I found this because I implemented an HttpSessionListener which needs to \naccess the session to get an attribute stored in the session. At the moment I \nget an IllegalState exception because the container already invalidated the \nsession (Tomcat 5.0.12).\n\nSee also: http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/BrowseList?\nlistId=88&by=thread&from=503705\n\n\nRegards,\nThorsten",
