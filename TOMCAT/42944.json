    "description": "Hi all,\n\nI had servlet-mappings that contain plus signs (they were created by JspC), e.g.:\n\n    <servlet-mapping>\n      <servlet-name>org.apache.jsp.suchergebnis_005fbu_002bbb_jsp</servlet-name>\n      <url-pattern>/suchergebnis_bu+bb.jsp</url-pattern>\n    </servlet-mapping>\n\nThis mapping does not work (the referred class is present)! When I change the\noriginal file names of the JSPs such that the plus signs are replaced by a minus\nsigns the following mapping results:\n\n    <servlet-mapping>\n      <servlet-name>org.apache.jsp.suchergebnis_005fbu_002dbb_jsp</servlet-name>\n      <url-pattern>/suchergebnis_bu-bb.jsp</url-pattern>\n    </servlet-mapping>\n\nNow the mapping works.\n\nTherefore I assume that there is a bug in handling servlet mappings with plus\nsigns in their url pattern.",
